About TeMMPo 
------------

 - https://www.temmpo.org.uk/

TeMMPo (Text Mining for Mechanism Prioritisation) is a web-based tool to enable researchers to identify the quantity of published evidence for specific mechanisms between an exposure and outcome. The tool identifies co-occurrence of MeSH headings in scientific publications to indicate papers that link an intermediate mechanism to either an exposure or an outcome.

TeMMPo is particularly useful when a specific lifestyle or dietary exposure is known to associate with a disease outcome, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms may help develop interventions, sub-classify disease or establish evidence for causality. TeMMPo quantifies the body of published literature to establish which mechanisms have been researched the most, enabling these mechanisms to be subjected to systematic review.

This development was funded by the World Cancer Research Fund UK, the UK Medical Research Council and the University of Bristol.

Installation

See helper scripts in deploy/*

To create a site on the development server run the build_site.sh script 
or use the local_build_site.sh if working on a desktop

Set up database:

# Run migrations to set up the database structure
cd src/temmpo
../../bin/python manage.py migrate

# More specific database migrations
../../bin/python manage.py migrate browser

# Create a super user
 ../../bin/python manage.py createsuperuser --settings=temmpo.settings.dev

Running tests:

cd src/temmpo
 ../../bin/python manage.py test tests/ --settings=temmpo.settings.dev

Deployment
----------

# Tag in git using fabric utilty function

# Tag release, e.g. version 0.4
fab taggit:master,0.4,temmpo

# Move/update prod_stable branch 
fab taggit:master,prod_stable,temmpo

# On production environment, e.g. 
cd /usr/local/projects/tmma/lib/prod/src/temmpo

# One off
git branch --set-upstream prod_stable origin/prod_stable
