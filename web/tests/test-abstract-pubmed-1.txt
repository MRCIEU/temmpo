AB  - FICTIONAL-GENE-A BACKGROUND/AIM: 1alpha,25(OH)2D has been shown to induce cell-cycle regulation,
      apoptosis and differentiation in prostate cancer cells. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that prostate and some prostate cancer cells have the ability to
      convert 25(OH)D3 TRPC1 to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. The aim of the present study was to
      elucidate the role of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 production by 25-hydroxyvitamin
      D-1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) on prostate cancer cell growth. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: LNCaP cells were FICTIONAL-GENE-B stably transfected with CYP27B. RESULTS:
      Stably-transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP cells converted 25(OH)D3 to
      1alpha,25(OH)2D3 unlike untransfected LNCaP cells. There was a dose-dependent
      decrease in (3)H-thymidine incorporation in 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated LNCaP cells,
      not seen with 25(OH)D3 treatment, and in stably transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP
      cells treated with 25(OH)D3. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated LNCaP cells and
      25(OH)D3-treated stably-transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP cells demonstrated an
      increased G1 phase accumulation and apoptosis, while 25(OH)D3 treatment had no
      effect in LNCaP cells. CONCLUSION: The present study supports the hypothesis that
      local production of 1alpha,25(OH)2D is important in inhibiting prostate cancer
      development and growth. FICTIONAL-GENE-C
