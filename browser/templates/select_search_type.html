Abstract
  Various 'omics' technologies, including microarrays and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, can be used to identify hundreds of interesting genes, proteins and metabolites, such as differential genes, proteins and metabolites associated with diseases. Identifying metabolic pathways has become an invaluable aid to understanding the genes and metabolites associated with studying conditions. However, the classical methods used to identify pathways fail to accurately consider joint power of interesting gene/metabolite and the key regions impacted by them within metabolic pathways. In this study, we propose a powerful analytical method referred to as Subpathway-GM for the identification of metabolic subpathways. This provides a more accurate level of pathway analysis by integrating information from genes and metabolites, and their positions and cascade regions within the given pathway. We analyzed two colorectal cancer and one metastatic prostate cancer data sets and demonstrated that Subpathway-GM was able to identify disease-relevant subpathways whose corresponding entire pathways might be ignored using classical entire pathway identification methods. Further analysis indicated that the power of a joint genes/metabolites and subpathway strategy based on their topologies may play a key role in reliably recalling disease-relevant subpathways and finding novel subpathways.

TI  - Copy number variations and cognitive phenotypes in unselected populations.
PG  - 2044-54
LID - 10.1001/jama.2015.4845 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The association of copy number variations (CNVs), differing numbers
      of copies of genetic sequence at locations in the genome, with phenotypes such as
      intellectual disability has been almost exclusively evaluated using clinically
      ascertained cohorts. The contribution of these genetic variants to cognitive
      phenotypes in the general population remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate
      the clinical features conferred by CNVs associated with known syndromes in adult 
      carriers without clinical preselection and to assess the genome-wide consequences
      of rare CNVs (frequency &lt;/=0.05%; size >/=250 kilobase pairs [kb]) on carriers'
      educational attainment and intellectual disability prevalence in the general
      population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The population biobank of Estonia 
      contains 52,000 participants enrolled from 2002 through 2010. General
      practitioners examined participants and filled out a questionnaire of health- and
      lifestyle-related questions, as well as reported diagnoses. Copy number variant
      analysis was conducted on a random sample of 7877 individuals and
      genotype-phenotype associations with education and disease traits were evaluated.
      Our results were replicated on a high-functioning group of 993 Estonians and 3
      geographically distinct populations in the United Kingdom, the United States, and
      Italy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Phenotypes of genomic disorders in the general
      population, prevalence of autosomal CNVs, and association of these variants with 
      educational attainment (from less than primary school through scientific degree) 
      and prevalence of intellectual disability. RESULTS: Of the 7877 in the Estonian
      cohort, we identified 56 carriers of CNVs associated with known syndromes. Their 
      phenotypes, including cognitive and psychiatric problems, epilepsy, neuropathies,
      obesity, and congenital malformations are similar to those described for carriers
      of identical rearrangements ascertained in clinical cohorts. A genome-wide
      evaluation of rare autosomal CNVs (frequency, &lt;/=0.05%; >/=250 kb) identified 831
      carriers (10.5%) of the screened general population. Eleven of 216 (5.1%)
      carriers of a deletion of at least 250 kb (odds ratio [OR], 3.16; 95% CI,
      1.51-5.98; P = 1.5e-03) and 6 of 102 (5.9%) carriers of a duplication of at least
      1 Mb (OR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.29-8.54; P = .008) had an intellectual disability
      compared with 114 of 6819 (1.7%) in the Estonian cohort. The mean education
      attainment was 3.81 (P = 1.06e-04) among 248 (>/=250 kb) deletion carriers and
      3.69 (P = 5.024e-05) among 115 duplication carriers (>/=1 Mb). Of the deletion
      carriers, 33.5% did not graduate from high school (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.95; P
      = .005) and 39.1% of duplication carriers did not graduate high school (OR, 1.89;
      95% CI, 1.27-2.8; P = 1.6e-03). Evidence for an association between rare CNVs and
      lower educational attainment was supported by analyses of cohorts of adults from 
      Italy and the United States and adolescents from the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: Known pathogenic CNVs in unselected, but assumed to be healthy,
      adult populations may be associated with unrecognized clinical sequelae.
      Additionally, individually rare but collectively common intermediate-size CNVs
      may be negatively associated with educational attainment. Replication of these
      findings in additional population groups is warranted given the potential
      implications of this observation for genomics research, clinical care, and public
      health.
