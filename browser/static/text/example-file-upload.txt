Abstract
  Various 'omics' technologies, including microarrays and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, can be used to identify hundreds of interesting genes, proteins and metabolites, such as differential genes, proteins and metabolites associated with diseases. Identifying metabolic pathways has become an invaluable aid to understanding the genes and metabolites associated with studying conditions. However, the classical methods used to identify pathways fail to accurately consider joint power of interesting gene/metabolite and the key regions impacted by them within metabolic pathways. In this study, we propose a powerful analytical method referred to as Subpathway-GM for the identification of metabolic subpathways. This provides a more accurate level of pathway analysis by integrating information from genes and metabolites, and their positions and cascade regions within the given pathway. We analyzed two colorectal cancer and one metastatic prostate cancer data sets and demonstrated that Subpathway-GM was able to identify disease-relevant subpathways whose corresponding entire pathways might be ignored using classical entire pathway identification methods. Further analysis indicated that the power of a joint genes/metabolites and subpathway strategy based on their topologies may play a key role in reliably recalling disease-relevant subpathways and finding novel subpathways.

Abstract
  Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) play a crucial role in cancer progression. In the present study we examined the regulation of PAI-1 and uPA expressions in normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3. The antigen and mRNA levels of PAI-1 were down-regulated in cancer cells, especially in LNCaP and DU-145. In the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, an increase of PAI-1 mRNA levels was observed in PrEC, LNCaP and PC-3, but not in DU-145 cells. Treatment with demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased the level of PAI-1 transcript in DU-145 cells and restored the inducing effect of cytokines on PAI-1 expression. An aberrant methylation of PAI-1 promoter in DU-145 and LNCaP cells was shown by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis. PAI-1 methylation was also significantly increased in tumor samples (23.2+/-1.7%) in comparison to adjacent non-tumor tissue (6.0+/-0.8%). Furthermore, the expression of uPA was increased in high invasive cell lines DU-145 and PC-3 in comparison to PrEC and low invasive LNCaP cells. MS-HRM analysis revealed aberrant methylation of uPA promoter in LNCaP cells, but not in PrEC, DU-145 and PC-3 cells, as well as in normal and prostate cancer tissue samples. In conclusion, the study shows that PAI-1 and uPA expressions were changed in opposite directions in high invasive prostate cancer cell lines resulting in a strong decrease of PAI-1/uPA ratio, which may indicate a shift towards proteolytic activities. Methylation of the PAI-1 gene is suggested as one of the molecular mechanisms involved in the cancer-associated down-regulation of the PAI-1 expression. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc.
