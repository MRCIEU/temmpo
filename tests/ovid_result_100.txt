Abstract
  BACKGROUND/AIM: 1alpha,25(OH)2D has been shown to induce cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis and differentiation in prostate cancer cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that prostate and some prostate cancer cells have the ability to convert 25(OH)D3 to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 production by 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) on prostate cancer cell growth.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: LNCaP cells were stably transfected with CYP27B.

  RESULTS: Stably-transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP cells converted 25(OH)D3 to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 unlike untransfected LNCaP cells. There was a dose-dependent decrease in (3)H-thymidine incorporation in 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated LNCaP cells, not seen with 25(OH)D3 treatment, and in stably transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP cells treated with 25(OH)D3. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated LNCaP cells and 25(OH)D3-treated stably-transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP cells demonstrated an increased G1 phase accumulation and apoptosis, while 25(OH)D3 treatment had no effect in LNCaP cells.

  CONCLUSION: The present study supports the hypothesis that local production of 1alpha,25(OH)2D is important in inhibiting prostate cancer development and growth.Copyright© 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G. Delinassios), All rights reserved.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Radiation-induced injury to normal tissues is a common complication of radiation therapy in cancer patients. Considering the role of vitamin D in mucosal barrier hemostasis and inflammatory responses, we investigated whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of radiation-induced acute proctitis in cancer patients.

  METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective observational study was conducted in cancer patients referred for pelvic radiation therapy. Serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured before radiation therapy. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of <35 nmol/L and <40 nmol/L in male and female patients, respectively, based on available normative data. Acute proctitis was assessed after 5 weeks of radiation therapy (total received radiation dose of 50 Gy) and graded from 0 to 4 using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria.

  RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (57.1% male) with a mean age of 62.8 +/- 9.1 years were studied. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 57 patients (58.1%). Symptoms of acute proctitis occurred in 72 patients (73.4%) after radiation therapy. RTOG grade was significantly higher in patients with vitamin D deficiency than in normal cases (median [interquartile range] of 2 [0.5-3] vs 1 [0-2], P=.037). Vitamin D deficiency was associated with RTOG grade of >2, independent of possible confounding factors; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 3.07 (1.27-7.50), P=.013.

  CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased severity of radiation-induced acute proctitis. Investigating the underlying mechanisms of this association and evaluating the effectiveness of vitamin D therapy in preventing radiation-induced acute proctitis is warranted.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Urologists have two scenarios where they have to address bone loss or increased risk of fractures in men with prostate cancer. In the first setting, a patient who has been started on androgen deprivation therapy may develop cancer-treatment-induced bone loss. In the second setting, a patient's prostate cancer may have metastasized to the bone. This article describes six steps to manage bone health in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in a community practice.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: In addition to the metabolic role of vitamin D, which is well known and clearly defined, there have been many hypotheses regarding its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic role. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANCE OF PROSTATE CANCER: Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in men. Long period of cancerogenesis, available tumor markers and high incidence make this cancer ideal for preventive measures. PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF VITAMIN D AND ITS EFFECT ON PROSTATE CANCER CELLS. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptopic role of vitamin D. Disorders of vitamin D metabolism are noted in vitamin D gene level, vitamin D receptor, vitamin D responsive elements and androgen receptors. We present the most important effect of those changes on vitamin D metabolism.

  CONCLUSION: Available studies on vitamin D level in serum, prostate tissue, observed activity of vitamin D enzymes and genetic changes give us only a slight insight into the basic mechanisms of vitamin D action in the development of prostate cancer; therefore, further investigations are needed.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/AIM: Vitamin D deficiency in African-Americans is common due to the high melanin content of the skin that reduces the absorption of UV radiation. To determine if there is a correlation between UV exposure, tanning potential and vitamin D with prostate cancer (PC) risk, we conducted a case-control study of 183 African-American men aged 40 years and older residing in the Washington, DC area.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: PC status was described as a binary variable as the presence or absence of cancer and the environmental factors as continuous variables. We used a logistic regression model describing PC as the response, while age, tanning potential, sunlight and vitamin D were treated as the predictors.

  RESULTS: Men aged 60 years and older had a seven-fold increased risk for developing PC compared to those aged 50 years and less (p<0.003). Tanning potential was a significant (p=0.05) risk factor for PC, while sunlight exposure and vitamin D were not. Tanning potential was also significant (p=0.044) when adjusted for vitamin D and age. However, tanning potential was only marginally significant when adjusted for sunlight exposure (p=0.064) CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that tanning potential may be a predictor for PC risk in African-American men.Copyright © 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.

Abstract
  A number of studies have shown that vitamin D has a protective effect against the development of cancer, which may also be related to prostate cancer. Low serum vitamin D concentration has also been demonstrated in benign prostate hyperplasia. We compared serum vitamin D concentration in two groups of Polish men with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. Each group comprised 30 patients. The concentration was determined by ELISA. To assess the difference between the study population, non-parametric Mann Whitney U test was used. The results revealed that patients with prostate cancer are deficient in vitamin D (median =25.3, quartiles q1 - q3: 13.4 -33.4). The concentration of vitamin D in the group of patients with prostate cancer was lower than in the group of benign prostatic hyperplasia with vitamin D deficiency (median =34.8, quartiles q1 - q3: 17.9  44.3). Vitamin D concentration in Polish men with prostate cancer is lower compared to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Abstract
  Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that regulates mineral homeostasis, bone metabolism and many other physiological processes. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D(3)), has broad spectrum antitumor activities and potentiates the effects of a number of chemotherapeutic agents. 1,25D(3) exerts its anti-tumor effects mainly through genomic mechanisms involving the regulation of gene transcription through vitamin D response elements (VDREs). More recently, miRNAs have been shown to be regulated by 1,25D(3). miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally modulate the expression of a wide range of genes. Therefore, they have important regulatory roles in the development and progression of many diseases including cancer. This review focuses on the regulation of miRNA expression by 1,25D(3) in cancer model systems and the contribution of the regulated miRNAs to the anti-tumor effect of 1,25D(3). In addition, the impact of miRNAs on 1,25D(3) signaling is discussed.

Abstract
  The effects of blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) on the risk of total, low-, and high-grade prostate cancer were examined in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). In the SELECT study, plasma 25-OHD levels were associated with a linear decrease in prostate cancer risk for high-grade cancers in African American men and an apparent "U"-shaped effect in other men. The "U-shaped" curve may reflect detection bias. In the PCPT study, in which detection bias was minimized, serum 25-OHD levels were associated with a linear decrease in the risk of high-grade prostate cancers. The results from these large prevention trials support the hypothesis that circulating levels of 25-OHD decrease the risk of clinically relevant prostate cancers.Copyright ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The antiproliferative effect of the active form of vitamin D on cancer cells and its ability to induce cell differentiation and suppression of tumor-induced angiogenesis in the last decade has provoked enormous research for the elucidation of its role in the prevention of different types of cancer and in slowing down the malignancy progression. The aim of the present pilot study was to determine the circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels in Bulgarian prostate cancer (PCa) patients and to investigate their relationship with various determinants associated with the severity and progression of the disease.

  METHODS: A total of 53 male patients (mean age 67.0 +/- 7.1 years) with clinical suspicion for PCa were enrolled in the study. All patients were subjected to systemic transrectal ultrasound-guided tru-cut prostate biopsies (10 cores at least). Detected tumors were graded using the Gleason grading system. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum levels were measured immunochemically. The 25OHD assay was performed by a validated HPLC-UV method. Other covariates (BMI, age, family history of PCa) were collected by interview at the time of hospitalization. One-way ANOVA with Kruskal Wallis statistics was used for comparison of medians of different parameters. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.

  RESULTS: Significantly lower 25OHD levels were detected in PCa patients compared to those with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (p < 0.05). Patients with high grade tumors (Gleason score > 7) showed significantly lower 25OHD levels, while those with low grade tumors (Gleason score < 7) revealed better 25OHD status (50.49 vs. 63.17 nmol/L, p < 0.05). A moderate negative correlation between 25OHD levels and the Gleason score was established (Spearman r = -0.46, p < 0.05). Significant seasonal variations in 25OHD levels, both for PCa and BPH patients, were detected (p < 0.01).

  CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows an association between 25OHD status and classical markers characterizing the severity of PCa. The results might suggest a potential beneficial role of vitamin D for PCa patients. Further prospective studies are needed to strengthen the interrelationships between 25OHD levels and variables related with PCa and to test them for causality.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains a common treatment for prostate cancer, even in the nonmetastatic setting and in scenarios without evidence of efficacy. Increasing attention has focused on its adverse effects, of which bone disease in the form of osteoporosis and fractures has been one of the major concerns. Recently published articles are reviewed, focusing on ADT effects on bone and management of ADT-associated bone disease.

  RECENT FINDINGS: A range of strategies directed at ADT-associated bone disease are available, including antiresorptive agents such as denosumab and bisphosphonates, as well as complementary approaches such as calcium and vitamin D supplementation, exercise regimens, and multifaceted interventions incorporating several approaches. Most interventions used bone mineral density as a surrogate outcome, despite compelling evidence that it inadequately captures fracture risk.

  SUMMARY: The antiresorptive agents are clearly able to preserve bone mineral density in men on ADT, whereas other approaches have modest to no benefits. Unfortunately, despite intense research interest in this area, no approach has yet demonstrated a definitive and convincing reduction in clinically relevant fracture outcomes. This emphasizes the importance of restricting the use of ADT to settings in which its benefits are clearly established, in order to limit unnecessary complications.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D (VitD) deficiency in men undergoing radical prostatectomy and determine whether an association exists between preoperative VitD levels and adverse pathologic features.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease from January to August 2012 were prospectively followed and those with available preoperative serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were included. Men with a known diagnosis of VitD deficiency or taking VitD supplementation were excluded. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine whether preoperative VitD level is predictive of adverse pathologic outcomes.

  RESULTS: One hundred consecutive men were included. Mean age was 62 (range, 42-79) years and mean VitD level was 26 (range, 6-57) ng/mL. Overall, 65 men (65%) had suboptimal levels of VitD (< 30 ng/mL), and 32 (32%) had deficiency (< 20 ng/mL). There was no significant correlation between VitD and age (P = .5). In logistic regression analysis, VitD level was not predictive of pathologic Gleason (P = .11), pathologic stage (P = .7), or positive margin status (P = .8).

  CONCLUSION: The association between VitD and prostate cancer has been controversial and data suggesting an increased risk of aggressive cancer in men with low levels of VitD have been inconsistent. We found that baseline preoperative VitD level was not associated with any adverse pathologic features. However, VitD deficiency is a common finding in this population, although unrelated to patient age. These results represent the first time the correlation between VitD and prostate cancer has been evaluated in a cohort of men undergoing radical prostatectomy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: Apart from the classic role of vitamin D, its hormonal active form, calcitriol is also characterized by pleiotropic effects on various organs and tissues. For the last several years, many researchers have shown an association between deficiency of vitamin D and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent investigations suggested the need of vitamin D supplementation in T2DM prevention. It was shown that vitamin D deficiency decreases insulin secretion. It was also observed that proper vitamin D supplementation may improve the ability of the cells of the islets of Langerhans to synthesize many proteins de novo and to convert proinsulin to insulin. Apart from regulating bone metabolism and also calcium and phosphate homeostasis, 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts antiproliferative and pro-differentiating effects on a wide variety of cell types. It also induces apoptosis of cancer cells and slows their proliferation. In a number of major studies the relationship between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of various cancers was observed. It concerns colorectal, lung, prostate, breast and ovarian cancer. It was observed that in patients with low serum vitamin D concentrations such disorders as ischemic heart disease, heart attack, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, and hypertension were more frequent and mortality was significantly higher. These results led the researchers to consider vitamin D deficiency as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases that may be related to low levels of vitamin D, is its adverse effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Calcitriol is also an important determinant of muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as inhibition of apoptosis. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin. However, there are only a few food products that are rich in vitamin D3, e.g.: fish oils, fish and fortified-products, such as dairy products and margarines. Individuals who are vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency should be supplemented.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among the male population worldwide. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to prostate cancer and its aggressiveness. Herein, we initiated a retrospective study to evaluate vitamin D status and monitoring in veterans with prostate cancer, and to examine the potential link between vitamin D and survival status and length of survival in this population. We found that veterans who were initially vitamin D deficient were significantly less likely to survive than those who were not initially deficient, and that both initial and follow-up vitamin D deficiency were associated with decreased likelihood of survival after prostate cancer diagnosis. We recommend that vitamin D deficiency be replaced in veterans with prostate cancer. Reprint & Copyright © 2014 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of osteoporosis and risk factors of osteoporotic fractures before androgen deprivation in Danish men. Treatment and prognosis of prostate cancer necessitate management of long-term consequences of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including accelerated bone loss resulting in osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures are associated with excess morbidity and mortality.

  MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with prostate cancer awaiting initiation of ADT were consecutively included. Half of the patients had localized disease and were referred for curative intended radiation, and the remaining patients had disseminated disease. Blood samples were collected, a questionnaire was administered and a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed before initiating ADT. The patients were included between January 2010 and March 2012. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. None of the patients had received prior androgen deprivation or osteoporosis treatment.

  RESULTS: In total, 105 individuals were included. The mean age of the participants was 70 years (range 53-91 years, SD 6.3). The median prostate-specific antigen level was 30.5 g/l (1-5714 g/l). The average Gleason score was 7.8 (range 5-10, SD 1.1). Fifty patients had localized prostate cancer and the other 55 patients had disseminated disease. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 10% and the prevalence of osteopenia was 58% before ADT. There was no significant difference between the two subgroups concerning osteoporosis. Smoking use was the only factor that was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of osteoporosis in the study population.

  CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of patients with prostate cancer awaiting ADT had osteoporosis or reduced bone mass. Further awareness regarding osteoporosis and bone health in prostate cancer is needed. It is suggested that patients with prostate cancer undergo a DXA scan before starting ADT.

Abstract
  It was suggested that vitamin D levels influence cancer development. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a crucial mediator for the cellular effects of vitamin D. In fact It has been hypothesized that polymorphisms in the VDR gene affect cancer risk and the relevance of VDR gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms for various types of cancer has been investigated by a great number of studies. However, results from previous studies on the association of VDR polymorphisms with different cancer types are somewhat contradictory, and the role of VDR in the etiology of cancer is still equivocal. We have performed a systematic review of the literature to analyze the relevance of more VDR polymorphisms (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, Apa1, and Cdx2) for individual malignancies, including cancer of the skin (melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer), ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, thyroid carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma, head and neck and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Up to June 2012, we identified 79 independent studies for a total of 52427 cases and 62225 controls. Significant associations with VDR polymorphisms have been reported for prostate (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1), breast (Fok1, Bsm1, Apa1), colon-rectum (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1) and skin cancer (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1). Very few studies reported risk estimates for the other cancer sites. Conflicting data have been reported for most malignancies and at present it is still not possible to make any definitive statements about the importance of the VDR genotype for cancer risk. It seems probable that interactions with other factors such as calcium and vitamin D intake, 25(OH)D plasma levels and UV radiation exposure play a decisive role in cancer risk. To conclude, there is some indication that VDR polymorphisms may modulate the risk of some cancer sites and in future studies VDR genetic variation should be integrated also with prediagnostic indicator of vitamin D status.

Abstract
  The role of vitamin D in cancer incidence and mortality has been investigated using several approaches, including using sun exposure as a proxy for vitamin D status, assessing vitamin D intake from food and supplements, using a predicted score to estimate vitamin D status, and directly measuring circulating 25(OH)D. A variety of complementary study designs have been implemented with various strengths and limitations. Although definitive randomized control trial data are lacking, there is strong evidence for a protective relationship of vitamin D and colorectal cancer incidence. Evidence for other cancers is not as consistent. More recently, large pooling projects have begun to investigate rarer cancers, studies have investigated common variation and expression of vitamin D-related genes and their relationships to cancer, and evidence has emerged on the role of vitamin D in cancer survival. Further study is needed to answer important questions that remain about the most affected cancer sites, the timing of vitamin D exposure in relation cancer etiology duringthe life span (e.g., adolescence or adulthood), the dose-response/optimal levels required for the most benefit, and which stages of carcinogenesis (e.g., incidence or progression) are most relevant.

Abstract
  In recent years, a rapidly increasing number of studies have investigated the relationship of vitamin D with total cancer and site-specific cancer obtaining diverse findings. In this chapter we provide an overview of epidemiological studies of vitamin D intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels and vitamin D associated polymorphisms in relation to total and site-specific cancer risk. Overall, epidemiological evidence for total cancer is inconclusive. However, a large number of studies support a relationship of vitamin D with colorectal cancer and to a lesser extent with breast cancer. Findings are inconsistent for other cancers including all other gastrointestinal cancers and prostate cancer. Different vitamin D associated polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated to colorectal, breast and prostate cancer risk.

Abstract
  A number of preclinical studies have shown that the activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) reduces prostate cancer (PCa) cell and tumor growth. The majority of human PCas express a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2):erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) fusion gene, but most preclinical studies have been performed in PCa models lacking TMPRSS2:ETS in part due to the limited availability of model systems expressing endogenous TMPRSS2:ETS. The level of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), is controlled in part by VDR-dependent induction of cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily 1, polypeptide1 (CYP24A1), which metabolizes 1,25D to an inactive form. Because ETS factors can cooperate with VDR to induce rat CYP24A1, we tested whether TMPRSS2:ETS would cause aberrant induction of human CYP24A1 limiting the activity of VDR. In TMPRSS2:ETS positive VCaP cells, depletion of TMPRSS2:ETS substantially reduced 1,25D-mediated CYP24A1 induction. Artificial expression of the type VI+72 TMPRSS2:ETS isoform in LNCaP cells synergized with 1,25D to greatly increase CYP24A1 expression. Thus, one of the early effects of TMPRSS2:ETS in prostate cells is likely a reduction in intracellular 1,25D, which may lead to increased proliferation. Next, we tested the net effect of VDR action in TMPRSS2:ETS containing PCa tumors in vivo. Unlike previous animal studies performed on PCa tumors lacking TMPRSS2:ETS, EB1089 (seocalcitol) (a less calcemic analog of 1,25D) did not inhibit the growth of TMPRSS2:ETS containing VCaP tumors in vivo, suggesting that the presence of TMPRSS2:ETS may limit the growth inhibitory actions of VDR. Our findings suggest that patients with TMPRSS2:ETS negative tumors may be more responsive to VDR-mediated growth inhibition and that TMPRSS2:ETS status should be considered in future clinical trials.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To investigate and clarify the relationship between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and prostate cancer risk.

  METHODS: We conducted the meta-analysis to better evaluate the association. Terms "25-Hydroxyvitamin D"/"vitamin D" and "prostate cancer" were used for literature search.

  RESULTS: We identified 21 relevant publications from databases of PubMed and MEDLINE and included 11,941 cases and 13,870 controls in the meta-analysis. Overall studies revealed a significant 17 % elevated risk of prostate cancer for individuals with higher level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (OR = 1.17, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.30, P  = 0.004), and no publication bias was found in the calculations (P  = 0.629). Subgroup analysis confirmed the association from nested case-control study group, studies from USA group and studies using serum samples group (nested case-control studies: OR = 1.17, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.27, P < 0.001; USA: OR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.29, P = 0.017; serum: OR = 1.20, 95 % CI = 1.01-1.42, P = 0.042); moreover, sensitivity tests also indicated significant results in studies from Europe and studies conducting with plasma samples after exclusion of some influential single study from the analysis, respectively (Europe: OR = 1.21, 95 % CI = 1.04-1.40, P = 0.014; plasma: OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 1.00-1.27, P = 0.05).

  CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis, for the first time, suggested significant positive relationship between high level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased risk of prostate cancer, reminding us that more concern should be taken into account during assessing the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Abstract
  Patients with prostate cancer often receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as part of their treatment regimen. However, treatment with ADT causes multiple side effects, including reduced bone mineral density (BMD), lower lean body mass, and a higher risk for fractures. Several organizations provide clinical practice guidelines for osteoporosis screening, prevention, and treatment in this population, but adherence to these guidelines remains low. Areas for improvement in provider adherence include baseline and follow-up BMD testing, as well as counseling regarding healthy bone behaviors such as calcium/vitamin D intake, lifestyle changes, and physical exercise. Comparison of osteoporosis care in breast cancer and non-oncology populations shows that suboptimal bone health care is not isolated to prostate cancer. A summary of the literature examining improvements in patient adherence and provider delivery of bone health care is included in this review, but high-quality studies are lacking. Patients may be the most receptive to written educational information delivered at or near the time of ADT initiation. Involvement of a primary care practitioner and oncologist in care delivery is associated with higher BMD test use. Institution-level programs that automatically initiate osteoporosis screening and management may be effective at reducing the incidence of hip fracture. Lastly, suggestions are provided for future approaches to knowledge translation and quality of care studies to improve bone health.

Abstract
  Vitamin D is not really a vitamin but the precursor to the potent steroid hormone calcitriol, which has widespread actions throughout the body. Calcitriol regulates numerous cellular pathways that could have a role in determining cancer risk and prognosis. Although epidemiological and early clinical trials are inconsistent, and randomized control trials in humans do not yet exist to conclusively support a beneficial role for vitamin D, accumulating results from preclinical and some clinical studies strongly suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing cancer and that avoiding deficiency and adding vitamin D supplements might be an economical and safe way to reduce cancer incidence and improve cancer prognosis and outcome.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Clinical and experimental observations reveal the exact role of vitamin D in prostate cancer. Yet, a complete understanding of the issue necessitates the evaluation of the exquisite mechanisms that involve full actors of the calcium homeostasis in relation.

  BACKGROUND: Besides the role of vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is now understood to be a mitogen for prostate cancer cells, and calcium has already been known for such role. The interplay between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system effector hormones and calcium homeostasis attracts attention in recent studies.

  METHODS: Twenty five patients with prostate cancer (median age 66 (62-67) years) who had presented at the Urology Outpatient Clinic were prospectively included in the study. Also, 30 volunteer controls (median age 63 (60-70) years) were enrolled for comparison. Serum total PSA, intact PTH, calcium, aldosterone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were detected in a selected group of patients with prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: The vitamin D levels were lower in PCa patients in line with some of the previous studies, supporting the role of vitamin D in prostate cancer. We also observed a positive correlation between PTH and PSA both in PCa patients and the controls.

  CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that like age and race, PSA is associated with PTH. The role of PTH, as a master of calcium homeostasis, seems to be neglected in prostate carcinogenesis, concerning a very few number of studies pertaining to the subject in the literature (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 19).

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Vitamin D3 might benefit prostate cancer (PCa) patients because prostate cells can locally synthesize the active hormone calcitriol.

  OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effects of oral vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolites and PCa proliferative activity in prostate tissue.

  DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada.

  PATIENTS: PCa patients (Gleason 6 or 7) participated in the study. Of 66 subjects who were enrolled, 63 completed the dosing protocol.

  INTERVENTION: Vitamin D3 (400, 10000, or 40000 IU/d) was orally administered before radical prostatectomy.

  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in surgical prostate tissue. Safety measures, PTH, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also assessed.

  RESULTS: Prostate tissue and serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, including calcitriol, increased dose dependently (P<.03) and were significantly higher in the 40000-IU/d group than in every other dose group (P<.03). Prostate vitamin D metabolites correlated positively with serum levels (P<.0001). Ki67 measures did not differ significantly among vitamin D dose groups. However, cross-sectional analysis indicated that the calcitriol level attained in prostate was inversely associated with Ki67 intensity and Ki67 (3+) percent positive nuclei in PCa and benign tissue (P<.05). Safety measures did not change adversely with dosing. Compared with the 400-IU/d group, serum PTH and PSA were lower in the combined higher-dose groups at the end of the study (P< .02).

  CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin D3 raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both PSA and PTH. Although Ki67 expression did not differ among dose groups, its levels correlated inversely with prostate calcitriol. These suggestions of clinical benefit justify continued clinical research.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Nested case-control designs are inevitably less efficient than full cohort designs, and it is important to use available information as efficiently as possible. Reuse of controls by inverse probability weighting may be one way to obtain efficiency improvements, and it can be particularly advantageous when two or more endpoints are analyzed in the same cohort. The controls in a nested case-control design are often matched on additional factors than at risk status, and this should be taken into account when reusing controls. Although some studies have suggested methods for handling additional matching, a thorough investigation of how this affects parameter estimates and weights is lacking. Our aim is to provide such a discussion to help developing guidelines for practitioners. We demonstrate that it is important to adjust for the matching variables in regression analyses when the matching is broken. We present three types of estimators for the inverse sampling probabilities accounting for additional matching. One of these estimators was somewhat biased when the cases and controls were matched very closely. We investigated how additional matching affected estimates of interest, with varying degree of association between the matching variables and exposure/outcome. Strong associations introduced only a small bias when the matching variables were properly adjusted for. Sometimes, exposure variables, for example, blood samples, are analyzed in batches. Rather, strong batch effects had to be present before this introduced much bias when the matching was broken. All simulations are based on a study of prostate cancer and vitamin D.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract
  Some evidence suggests that Ca and vitamin D supplements affect cancer risk; however, it is uncertain whether the effects are due to Ca, vitamin D or the combination. We investigated the effect of Ca supplements without co-administered vitamin D on cancer risk. Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists of meta-analyses and two clinical trial registries were searched for randomised, placebo-controlled trials of Ca supplements ( > 500 mg/d), with > 100 participants and duration >1 year. The lead authors of eligible trials supplied data on cancer outcomes. Trial-level data were analysed using random-effects meta-analyses and patient-level data using Cox proportional hazards models. A total of sixteen trials were eligible, six had no data available, ten provided trial-level data (n 10,496, mean duration 39 years), and of these, four provided patient-level data (n 7221, median duration 35 years). In the meta-analysis of trial-level data, allocation to Ca did not alter the risk of total cancer (relative risk 095, 95% CI 076, 118, P= 063), colorectal cancer (relative risk 138, 95% CI 089, 215, P= 015), breast cancer (relative risk 101, 95% CI 064, 159, P= 097) or cancer-related mortality (relative risk 096, 95% CI 074, 124, P= 075), but reduced the risk of prostate cancer (relative risk 054, 95 % CI 030, 096, P= 003), although there were few events. The meta-analysis of patient-level data showed similar results, with no effect of Ca on the risk of total cancer (hazard ratio 107, 95% CI 089, 128, P= 050). Ca supplements without co-administered vitamin D did not alter total cancer risk over 4 years, although the meta-analysis lacked power to detect very small effects, or those with a longer latency.

Abstract
  SUMMARY: Androgen deprivation therapy in 80 men was associated with declines in bone mineral density (BMD), which were greatest in the first year, and in the lumbar spine compared to controls. Vitamin D use was associated with improved BMD in the lumbar spine and in the first year.

  INTRODUCTION: Decreased BMD is a common side effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), leading to increased risk of fractures. Although loss of BMD appears to be greatest within the first year of starting ADT, there are few long-term studies of change in BMD, and risk factors for bone loss are not well-characterized.

  METHODS: Men aged 50+ with nonmetastatic prostate cancer starting continuous ADT were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study. BMD was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and yearly for 3 years. Matched controls were men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT. Multivariable regression analysis examined predictors of BMD loss.

  RESULTS: Eighty ADT users and 80 controls were enrolled (mean age 69 years); 52.5 % had osteopenia and 8.1 % had osteoporosis at baseline. After 1 year, in adjusted models, ADT was associated with significant losses in lumbar spine BMD compared to controls (-2.57 %, p=0.006), with a trend towards greater declines at the total hip (p=0.09). BMD changes in years 2 and 3 were much smaller and not statistically different from controls. Use of vitamin D but not calcium was associated with improved BMD in the lumbar spine in year 1 (+6.19 %, p<0.001) with smaller nonsignificant increases at other sites (+0.86 % femoral neck, +0.86 % total hip, p>0.10) primarily in the first year.

  CONCLUSIONS: Loss of BMD associated with ADT is greatest at the lumbar spine and in the first year. Vitamin D but not calcium may be protective particularly in the first year of ADT use.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that low levels of vitamin D may be associated with prostate cancer, and darker skin reduces the body's ability to generate vitamin D from sunshine. The impact of sunshine on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality is unknown.

  METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database, the authors calculated age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates among black and white men aged > 45 years by race and county between 2000 and 2009 (N=906,381 men). Similarly, county-level prostate cancer mortality rates were calculated from the National Vital Statistics System (N=288,874). These data were linked with the average monthly solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation index by county and data regarding health, wellness, and demographics. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess whether increases in the UV index (in deciles) moderated the association between black race and the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: Compared with counties in the lowest UV index decile, prostate cancer incidence rates for white and black men were lower in counties with a higher UV index (all Ps<0.051). Incidence rates were higher for black men versus white men, but the difference by race was less for counties in the fourth to fifth UV index deciles versus those in the first decile (Ps < 0.02). Mortality rates also were found to decrease with increasing UV index for white men (Ps < 0.003), but increase for black men, and an unexplained increase in racial differences in mortality rates was observed with an increasing UV index.

  CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in the incidence of prostate cancer were larger in some areas with less sunshine. Additional research should confirm the findings of the current study and assess whether optimizing vitamin D levels among black men can reduce disparities.Copyright © 2013 American Cancer Society.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Ecological, in vitro, and in vivo studies demonstrate a link between vitamin D and prostate tumor growth and aggressiveness. The goal of this study was to investigate whether plasma concentration of vitamin D is associated with survivorship and disease progression in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of 1476 prostate cancer patients to assess disease recurrence/progression and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) risks associated with serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D [25(OH)D].

  RESULTS: There were 325 recurrence/progression and 95 PCSM events during an average of 10.8 years of follow-up. Serum levels of 25(OH)D were not associated with risk of recurrence/progression or mortality. Clinically deficient vitamin D levels were associated with an increased risk of death from other causes.

  CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that serum vitamin D levels measured after diagnosis affect prostate cancer prognosis. Lower levels of vitamin D were associated with risk of non-prostate cancer mortality.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and its metabolites are believed to impede carcinogenesis by stimulating cell differentiation, inhibiting cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis. Certain pesticides have been shown to deregulate vitamin D's anticarcinogenic properties. We hypothesize that certain pesticides may be linked to prostate cancer via an interaction with vitamin D genetic variants.

  METHODS: We evaluated interactions between 41 pesticides and 152 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in nine vitamin D pathway genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1,444 male controls in a nested case-control study of Caucasian pesticide applicators within the Agricultural Health Study. We assessed Pinteraction values using likelihood ratio tests from unconditional logistic regression and a false discovery rate (FDR) to account for multiple comparisons.

  RESULTS: Five significant interactions (P < 0.01) displayed a monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk with individual pesticide use in one genotype and no association in the other. These interactions involved parathion and terbufos use and three vitamin D genes (VDR, RXRB, and GC). The exposure-response pattern among participants with increasing parathion use with the homozygous CC genotype for GC rs7041 compared with unexposed participants was noteworthy [low vs. no exposure: OR, 2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-6.25; high vs. no exposure: OR, 3.09, 95% CI, 1.10-8.68; Pinteraction = 3.8 x 10(-3)].

  CONCLUSIONS: In this study, genetic variations in vitamin D pathway genes, particularly GC rs7041, an SNP previously linked to lower circulating vitamin D levels, modified pesticide associations with prostate cancer risk.

  IMPACT: Because our study is the first to examine this relationship, additional studies are needed to rule out chance findings.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To briefly review recent work within the vitamin D and cancer field, whereas also providing context relating how these findings may impact clinical care and future research efforts.

  RECENT FINDINGS: Vitamin D has now been convincingly shown both in vitro and in preclinical animal models to alter the differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of cancer cells. Whether vitamin D prevents cancer in humans or limits cancer progression, however, remain open questions. Epidemiologic and observational data relating circulating 25(OH)D levels and cancer risk suggest an inverse relationship for most cancers including breast, colorectal, leukemia and lymphoma, and prostate, although for each malignancy there also exist studies that have failed to demonstrate such an inverse relationship. Likewise, a more recent report failed to confirm a previously reported association of increased pancreatic cancer risk in patients with higher 25(OH)D levels. A large prospective study in which patients aged at least 50 years receive 2000 IU vitamin D3 daily for 5 years, with cancer as a primary endpoint, has recently been launched.

  SUMMARY: Although much effort has attempted to delineate a causal relationship between vitamin D and a wide array of human cancers, we await large-scale randomized controlled trial data for definitive answers.

Abstract
  Vitamin D promotes the differentiation of prostate cancer cells, raising the possibility that vitamin D deficiency over time may contribute to the progression from subclinical prostate cancer to clinical disease. Since low-risk prostate cancers are monitored over time in an effort to determine which progress into clinically important, more aggressive cancers, they provide an excellent model in which to study, over an extended period of time, the effects of enhancing vitamin D status and related changes in tumor progression. This is particularly relevant to African-American men, who exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as well as higher incidence of prostate cancer and higher mortality rates from prostate cancer than Caucasians. Our research team has recently completed an open-label clinical trial aimed at assessing the safety and potential efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 international units (IU) per day for one year in subjects diagnosed with early stage, low-risk prostate cancer. The results of this clinical study suggest that supplementation with vitamin D3 at 4000IU per day may benefit patients with early stage, low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance, because of the improved outcome (a decreased number of positive cores at repeat biopsy) in more than half of the subjects enrolled in the trial. We also observed that, after one year of supplementation, there was no difference in circulating levels of vitamin D between African-American and Caucasian subjects who completed the study. These clinical results also suggest that robust and sustained vitamin D3 supplementation can reduce prostate cancer-related health disparities in African-American men and that these health disparities are at least in part the result of widespread hypovitaminosis D within the African-American population.

Abstract
  In 2010, in France, 8,790 men died from prostate cancer despite a low and decreasing mortality rate. The individual risk/benefit ratio of prostate cancer screening is the focus of controversy and currently not in favor of a systematic screening program. Therefore, only prevention could reduce incidence, side effects of treatment and related mortality. Interestingly, prostate cancer prevention is also a field of controversy mainly about 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. However, it could be expected that pharmaco- or diet-based prevention will be a huge tool for cancer control, even more for prostate cancer burden. This review comprehensively analyses which molecules or compounds could be used in preventive trials. With regard to pharmaco-prevention, three different kinds of drugs could be identified. First drugs, which aim at mainly or even solely reduce prostate cancer risk such as 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Drugs, which aim at wider preventive impact such as: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or difluoromethylornithine. Lastly, drugs for which reducing prostate cancer incidence is merely a side effect such as statins, metformin or histones desacetylase inhibitors. With regard to diet-based prevention, two main approaches could be identified: aliments and nutriments, on one hand, and vitamin and minerals, on the other. Interestingly if compounds reach experimental plausibility, natural foods or even global diet seem to have a higher impact. Lastly, besides assessment of efficacy, effectiveness required the critical step of compliance, which might actually be the weakest link of the prevention chain.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and second leading cause of cancer related deaths in American men supporting the study of prostate cancer chemoprevention. Major risk factors for this disease have been associated with low serum levels of vitamin D. Here, we evaluate the biologic activity of a less calcemic vitamin D analog 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2 [1alpha-OH-D2] (Bone Care International, Inc.) in patients with prostate cancer and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG PIN).

  METHODS: Patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer and HG PIN were randomized to 1alpha-OH-D2 versus placebo for 28 days prior to radical prostatectomy. Intermediate endpoint biomarkers included serum vitamin D metabolites, TGFs 1/2, free/total PSA, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, bFGF, and VEGF. Tissue endpoints included histology, MIB-1 and TUNEL staining, microvessel density and factor VIII staining, androgen receptor and PSA, vitamin D receptor expression and nuclear morphometry.

  RESULTS: The 1alpha-OH-D2 vitamin D analog was well tolerated and could be safely administered with good compliance and no evidence of hypercalcemia over 28 days. While serum vitamin D metabolite levels only slightly increased, evidence of biologic activity was observed with significant reductions in serum PTH levels. TGF-s2 was the only biomarker significantly altered by vitamin D supplementation. Whether reduced TGF-s2 levels in our study is an early indicator of response to vitamin D remains unclear.

  CONCLUSIONS: While further investigation of vitamin D may be warranted based on preclinical studies, results of the present trial do not appear to justify evaluation of 1alpha-OH-D2 in larger clinical prostate cancer prevention studies.Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  MiR-100 and miR-125b are lost in many cancers and have potential function as tumor suppressors. Using both primary prostatic epithelial cultures and laser capture-microdissected prostate epithelium from 45 patients enrolled in a vitamin D3 randomized trial, we identified miR-100 and -125b as targets of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). In patients, miR-100 and -125b levels were significantly lower in tumor tissue than in benign prostate. Similarly, miR-100 and -125b were lower in primary prostate cancer cells than in cells derived from benign prostate. Prostatic concentrations of 1,25D positively correlated with these miRNA levels in both prostate cancer and benign epithelium, showing that patients with prostate cancer may still benefit from vitamin D3. In cell assays, upregulation of these miRNAs by 1,25D was vitamin D receptor dependent. Transfection of pre-miR-100 and pre-miR-125b in the presence or absence of 1,25D decreased invasiveness of cancer cell, RWPE-2. Pre-miR-100 and pre-miR-125b decreased proliferation in primary cells and cancer cells respectively. Pre-miR-125b transfection suppressed migration and clonal growth of prostate cancer cells, whereas knockdown of miR-125b in normal cells increased migration indicates a tumor suppressor function. 1,25D suppressed expression of previously bona fide mRNA targets of these miRNAs, E2F3 and Plk1, in a miRNA-dependent manner. Together, these findings show that vitamin D3 supplementation augments tumor suppressive miRNAs in patient prostate tissue, providing evidence that miRNAs could be key physiologic mediators of vitamin D3 activity in prevention and early treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract
  We recently reported a significant positive association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, and prostate cancer risk. To further elucidate this association, we examined the influence of vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), the primary transporter of vitamin D compounds in the circulation. Prediagnostic serum concentrations of DBP were assayed for 950 cases and 964 matched controls with existing 25(OH)D measurements within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study of Finnish men. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and statistical tests were two sided. Serum DBP modified the association between serum 25(OH)D and prostate cancer, with higher risk for elevated 25(OH)D levels observed primarily among men having DBP concentrations above the median (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.18-2.79 for highest vs. lowest quintile, p-trend = 0.001) compared to those with DBP below the median (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.81-1.84, p-trend 0.97; p-interaction = 0.04). Serum DBP was not associated with prostate cancer risk overall (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33 for highest vs. lowest quintile); however, high serum DBP was associated with significantly decreased risk of prostate cancer in men with lower (<median) 25(OH)D concentrations (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.90 for highest vs. lowest quintile, p-trend = 0.003) and increased risk in men with higher 25(OH)D concentrations (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.98-2.20, p-trend 0.10, p-interaction = 0.02). Our data suggest that the primary vitamin D carrier protein, DBP, modulates the impact of vitamin D status on prostate cancer.Copyright © 2012 UICC.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Vitamin D3 might benefit prostate cancer (PCa) patients because prostate cells can locally synthesize the active hormone calcitriol.

  OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effects of oral vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolites and PCa proliferative activity in prostate tissue.

  DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada.

  PATIENTS: PCa patients (Gleason 6 or 7) participated in the study. Of 66 subjects who were enrolled, 63 completed the dosing protocol.

  INTERVENTION: Vitamin D3 (400, 10 000, or 40 000 IU/d) was orally administered before radical prostatectomy.

  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in surgical prostate tissue. Safety measures, PTH, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also assessed.

  RESULTS: Prostate tissue and serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, including calcitriol, increased dose dependently (P < .03) and were significantly higher in the 40 000-IU/d group than in every other dose group (P < .03). Prostate vitamin D metabolites correlated positively with serum levels (P < .0001). Ki67 measures did not differ significantly among vitamin D dose groups. However, cross-sectional analysis indicated that the calcitriol level attained in prostate was inversely associated with Ki67 intensity and Ki67 (3+) percent positive nuclei in PCa and benign tissue (P < .05). Safety measures did not change adversely with dosing. Compared with the 400-IU/d group, serum PTH and PSA were lower in the combined higher-dose groups at the end of the study (P < .02).

  CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin D3 raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both PSA and PTH. Although Ki67 expression did not differ among dose groups, its levels correlated inversely with prostate calcitriol. These suggestions of clinical benefit justify continued clinical research.

Abstract
  Vitamin D has broad range of physiological functions and antitumor effects. 24-Hydroxylase, encoded by the CYP24A1 gene, is the key enzyme for degrading many forms of vitamin D including the most active form, 1,25D(3). Inhibition of CYP24A1 enhances 1,25D(3) antitumor activity. To isolate regulators of CYP24A1 expression in prostate cancer cells, we established a stable prostate cancer cell line PC3 with CYP24A1 promoter driving luciferase expression to screen a small molecular library for compounds that inhibit CYP24A1 promoter activity. From this screening, we identified, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole (TBBz), a protein kinase CK2 selective inhibitor as a disruptor of CYP24A1 promoter activity. We show that TBBz inhibits CYP24A1 promoter activity induced by 1,25D(3) in prostate cancer cells. In addition, TBBz downregulates endogenous CYP24A1 mRNA level in TBBz-treated PC3 cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated CK2 knockdown reduces 1,25D(3)-induced CYP24A1 mRNA expression in PC3 cells. These results suggest that CK2 contributes to 1,25D(3)-mediated target gene expression. Finally, inhibition of CK2 by TBBz or CK2 siRNA significantly enhances 1,25D(3)-mediated antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model. In summary, our findings reveal that protein kinase CK2 is involved in the regulation of CYP24A1 expression by 1,25D(3) and CK2 inhibitor enhances 1,25D(3)-mediated antitumor effect.Copyright ©2013 AACR.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Ecological and epidemiological studies have identified an inverse association of intensity and duration of sunlight exposure with prostate cancer, which may be explained by a reduction in vitamin D synthesis. Pigmentation traits influence sun exposure and therefore may affect prostate cancer risk. Because observational studies are vulnerable to confounding and measurement error, we used Mendelian randomization to examine the relationship of sun exposure with both prostate cancer risk and the intermediate phenotype, plasma levels of vitamin D.

  METHODS: We created a tanning, a skin color, and a freckling score as combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been previously associated with these phenotypes. A higher score indicates propensity to burn, have a lighter skin color and freckles. The scores were tested for association with vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin-D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D) and prostate-specific antigen detected prostate cancer in 3,123 White British individuals enrolled in the Prostate Testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study.

  RESULTS: The freckling score was inversely associated with 25(OH)D levels [change in 25(OH)D per score unit -0.27; 95% CI, -0.52% to -0.01%], and the tanning score was positively associated with prostate cancer risk (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09), after adjustment for population stratification and potential confounders.

  CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who tend to burn are more likely to spend less time in the sun and consequently have lower plasma vitamin D levels and higher susceptibility to prostate cancer.

  IMPACT: The use of pigmentation-related genetic scores is valuable for the assessment of the potential benefits of sun exposure with respect to prostate cancer risk.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that vitamin D status may be associated with prostate cancer risk although the direction and strength of this association differs between experimental and observational studies. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status. We examined prostate cancer risk in relation to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in four genes shown to predict circulating levels of 25(OH)D.

  METHODS: SNP markers localized to each of four genes (GC, CYP24A1, CYP2R1, and DHCR7) previously associated with 25(OH)D were genotyped in 10,018 cases and 11,052 controls from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. Logistic regression was used to estimate the individual and cumulative association between genetic variants and risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: We observed a decreased risk of aggressive prostate cancer among men with the allele in rs6013897 near CYP24A1 associated with lower serum 25(OH)D [per A allele, OR, 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-0.93; Ptrend = 0.0002) but an increased risk for nonaggressive disease (per A allele: OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17; Ptrend = 0.002). Examination of a polygenic score of the four SNPs revealed statistically significantly lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer among men with a greater number of low vitamin D alleles (OR for 6-8 vs. 0-1 alleles, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.98; Ptrend = 0.003).

  CONCLUSIONS: In this large, pooled analysis, genetic variants related to lower 25(OH)D levels were associated with a decreased risk of aggressive prostate cancer.

  IMPACT: Our genetic findings do not support a protective association between loci known to influence vitamin D levels and prostate cancer risk.

Abstract
  The number of studies reporting on the association between sunlight exposure, vitamin D and cancer risk is steadily increasing. We reviewed all published case-control and cohort studies concerning colorectal-, prostate-, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and both sunlight and vitamin D to update our previous review and to verify if the epidemiological evidence is in line with the hypothesis that the possible preventive effect of sunlight on cancer might be mediated not only by vitamin D but also by other pathways. We found that almost all epidemiological studies suggest that chronic (not intermittent) sun exposure is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal-, breast-, prostate cancer and NHL. In colorectal- and to a lesser degree in breast cancer vitamin D levels were found to be inversely associated with cancer risk. In prostate cancer and NHL, however, no associations were found. These findings are discussed and it is concluded that the evidence that sunlight is a protective factor for colorectal-, prostate-, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is still accumulating. The same conclusion can be drawn concerning high vitamin D levels and the risk of colorectal cancer and possibly breast cancer. Particularly in prostate cancer and NHL other sunlight potentiated and vitamin D independent pathways, such as modulation of the immune system and the circadian rhythm, and the degradation of folic acid might play a role in reduced cancer risk as well.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  The active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), is mostly known for its importance in the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. However, next to its classical effects on bone, kidney and intestine, 1,25(OH)2D3 also exerts antineoplastic effects on various types of cancer. The use of 1,25(OH)2D3 itself as treatment against neoplasia is hampered by its calcemic side effects. Therefore, 1,25(OH)2D3-derived analogs were developed that are characterized by lower calcemic side effects and stronger antineoplastic effects. This review mainly focuses on the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in breast, prostate and colorectal cancer (CRC) and the underlying signaling pathways. 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs inhibit proliferation, angiogenesis, migration/invasion and induce differentiation and apoptosis in malignant cell lines. Moreover, prostaglandin synthesis and Wnt/b-catenin signaling are also influenced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs. Human studies indicate an inverse association between serum 25(OH)D3 values and the incidence of certain cancer types. Given the literature, it appears that the epidemiological link between vitamin D3 and cancer is the strongest for CRC, however more intervention studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to unravel the beneficial dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs to induce antineoplastic effects.

Abstract
  To explore the mechanism and synergistic effect of vitamin A and vitamin D in inducing apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. The cell proliferation activity was determined by MTT assay. The proportion of apoptotic cells was analyzed by FACS and fluorescence intensity. TUNEL was used to evaluate vitamin A and vitamin D's induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The protein and mRNA expression level of Cyclin D1 and Bax were determined by real time-PCR and western blot. The results of MTT showed vitamin A and vitamin D's inhibition on proliferation ratio in prostate cancer cells is time and concentration dependent. FACS and fluorescence intensity analysis proved that the proportion of apoptotic cells increased after vitamin A and vitamin D treatment. TUNEL showed vitamin A and vitamin D induced prostate cancer cells apoptosis. The combination of vitamin A and vitamin D markedly enhanced the expression of Bax and reduced the expression of Cyclin D1 by real time-PCR and western blot assay. In conclusion, vitamin A and vitamin D could synergistically induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.

Abstract
  The hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of clinical prostate cancer has stimulated an extensive body of research. Ecologic studies have shown that mortality rates from prostate cancer are inversely correlated with levels of ultraviolet radiation, the principal source of vitamin D. Human prostate cells express receptors for 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D which exerts pleitropic anticancer effects on these cells in vitro and in animal models. Moreover, normal prostate cells synthesize 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D from circulating levels of 25-OHD, whose levels are dependent on exposure to ultraviolet light. Analytic epidemiologic studies of vitamin D and prostate cancer have focused on polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR), on serum vitamin D levels, and on solar exposure. A role for VDR polymorphisms in prostate cancer risk and progression is established. Prospective studies of serum 25(OH)D do not support a protective role for higher levels of 25(OH)D on prostate cancer risk overall, but a role for vitamin D deficiency is supported by several studies. Conversely, a growing body of evidence implicates low levels of 25-OHD with an increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. The results of most epidemiologic studies of sunlight exposure are consistent with a protective effect of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The discrepancy between the results of studies of solar exposure and studies of serum 25-OHD may be related to methodological differences and to uncertainties regarding the critical period for vitamin D exposure. Additionally, both high dietary intake of calcium and high levels of calcium in serum are positively associated with prostate cancer risk. The relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of prostate cancer may differ by calcium intake.

Abstract
  Current diagnostic tests cannot differentiate the majority of prostate cancers with a low likelihood of progression from the minority with more aggressive potential. We examined whether the measures of vitamin D were associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in men undergoing active monitoring. We examined the associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and vitamin D pathway polymorphisms with PSA doubling time in 490 men undergoing active monitoring for localized prostate cancer within a UK population-based cohort study [mean follow-up 4.4 years (range: 0.3-7.6)]. Repeat PSA measurements were analyzed using multilevel models. There was no evidence that circulating 25(OH)D levels, 1,25(OH)2D levels, or vitamin D pathway polymorphisms were associated with postdiagnosis PSA doubling time. Stratifying the results by prostate cancer grade at diagnosis (high grade or low grade) did not alter the results. We found no evidence that either circulating 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, or vitamin D pathway polymorphisms were associated with PSA doubling time in men undergoing active monitoring for localized prostate cancer. Future studies should examine the associations of variation in vitamin D with clinical outcomes (metastases and death).

Abstract
  The anti-tumor effect of vitamin D has been well recognized but its translational application is hindered by side effects induced by supra-physiological concentration of vitamin D required for cancer treatment. Thus, exploring the vitamin D tumor suppressive functional mechanism can facilitate improvement of its clinical application. We screened miRNA profiles in response to vitamin D and found that a tumor suppressive miRNA, miR-98, is transcriptionally induced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD) in LNCaP. Mechanistic dissection revealed that 1,25-VD-induced miR-98 is mediated through both a direct mechanism, enhancing the VDR binding response element in the promoter region of miR-98, and an indirect mechanism, down-regulating LIN-28 expression. Knockdown of miR-98 led to a reduction of 1,25-VD anti-growth effect and overexpression of miR-98 suppressed the LNCaP cells growth via inducing G2/M arrest. And CCNJ, a protein controlling cell mitosis, is down-regulated by miR-98 via targeting 3'-untranslated region of CCNJ. Interestingly, miR-98 levels in blood are increased upon 1,25-VD treatment in mice suggesting the biomarker potential of miR-98 in predicting 1,25-VD response. Together, the finding that growth inhibitive miR-98 is induced by 1,25-VD provides a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer and a potential biomarker for 1,25-VD anti-tumor action.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Bony metastases cause substantial morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer (PCa). The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is expressed on prostate tumors and may participate in bone metastases development. We assessed whether (i) common genetic variation in CaSR was associated with PCa risk and (ii) these associations varied by calcium intake or plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels.

  METHODS: We included 1,193 PCa cases and 1,244 controls nested in the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1993-2004). We genotyped 18 CaSR single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) to capture common variation. The main outcome was risk of lethal PCa (n = 113); secondary outcomes were overall (n = 1,193) and high-grade PCa (n = 225). We used the kernel machine approach to conduct a gene-level multimarker analysis and unconditional logistic regression to compute per-allele ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for individual SNPs.

  RESULTS: The joint association of SNPs in CaSR was significant for lethal PCa (P = 0.04); this association was stronger in those with low 25(OH)D (P = 0.009). No individual SNPs were associated after considering multiple testing; three SNPs were nominally associated (P < 0.05) with lethal PCa with ORs (95% CI) of 0.65(0.42-0.99): rs6438705; 0.65(0.47-0.89): rs13083990; and 1.55(1.09-2.20): rs2270916. The three nonsynonymous SNPs (rs1801725, rs1042636, and rs1801726) were not significantly associated; however, the association for rs1801725 was stronger in men with low 25(OH)D [OR(95%CI): 0.54(0.31-0.95)]. There were no significant associations with overall or high-grade PCa.

  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that CaSR may be involved in PCa progression.

  IMPACT: Further studies investigating potential mechanisms for CaSR and PCa, including bone remodeling and metastases are warranted.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: It is biologically plausible that vitamin D might prevent prostate cancer. However, recent meta-analyses concluded that there is no consistent relation between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and prostate cancer, and several large studies have actually reported an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with high 25(OH)D.

  OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the prospective relations between serum 25(OH)D, serum retinol, and risk of prostate cancer.

  DESIGN: In this nested case-control study, Norwegian men who participated in population-based health studies between 1981 and 1991 were followed with respect to prostate cancer throughout 2006. For each case (n = 2106), a matched control was selected. Stored serum was analyzed for 25(OH)D by using HPLC atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry.

  RESULTS: We showed a positive relation between an increasing 25(OH)D concentration and prostate cancer risk [rate ratio (RR): 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.27) per 30-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D concentration]. Predefined analyses stratified by season showed no relation for subjects with serum collected during winter and spring (RR: 1.00 per 30-nmol/L increase), whereas a strengthened positive association [RR: 1.27 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.47) per 30-nmol/L increase] was observed in men with serum collected during the summer and autumn. There was no relation between serum retinol and prostate cancer.

  CONCLUSIONS: The cause for increased risk of prostate cancer related to a high 25(OH)D concentration only during the summer and autumn is not obvious. The effect may be related to vitamin D itself or to other factors associated with sun exposure.

Abstract
  The bond between the research laboratory and the clinic is especially strong in the field of photomedicine. Much is learned in preclinical animal models, which is translated to the clinic for investigation, and then refinements in theory and technique are explored back in the laboratory. With many cancers becoming resistant to treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a mechanistically distinct alternative. Studies have shown that PDT not only mitigates chemoresistance but also synergizes with chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies. From the world of biochemistry comes this unique look at 2 approaches to maximize the photodynamic effect through PDT combinations with targeted therapies: 1) using the molecular response after PDT to guide the selection of targeted agents and 2) preconditioning cancer cells to modulate nuclear molecular targets before PDT.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Some epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin A (retinol), vitamin E, and vitamin D (total 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin, 1,25(OH)(2)D) are protective against prostate cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive, with positive and null associations reported for all three vitamins. Limitations of previous studies include small sample size, lack of population controls, and reliance on self-reported dietary intake. Few studies have explored the interactions of circulating 25(OH)D with 1,25(OH)(2)D or retinol, which are biologically plausible interactions.

  METHODS: We investigated the associations of circulating retinol, vitamin E, and 1,25(OH)(2)D with PSA-detected prostate cancer risk, stage, and grade in a case-control study nested within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial. We investigated the possibility of an interaction between 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D and whether the previously observed association between 25(OH)D and prostate cancer may be modified by retinol levels.

  RESULTS: We included 1,433 prostate cancer cases and 1,433 healthy controls. There was no evidence of associations of circulating retinol, vitamin E, or 1,25(OH)(2)D with overall prostate cancer risk, stage (advanced vs localized), or Gleason grade (high- (>7) vs low (<7) grade). There was no evidence of an interaction of 1,25(OH)(2)D and 25(OH)D with prostate cancer risk, stage, or grade (p interaction > 0.24). The association between 25(OH)D and prostate cancer did not differ by retinol level (p interaction = 0.34).

  CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that retinol, vitamin E, or 1,25(OH)(2)D concentrations were associated with overall prostate cancer risk or more aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes. There was no evidence of an interaction between 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D or retinol.

Abstract
  Osteoporosis is a common side effect of treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer. ADT may prolong survival; however, deterioration of bone mass density occurs soon after initiation. A systematic review of current literature revealed the importance of adequate nutrition during treatment with ADT to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. More specifically, this literature stressed achieving adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D through a combination of supplements and food. The necessity of providing nutrition education to patients with prostate cancer at initiation of ADT was identified. Healthcare professionals, including nurses, oncologists, and dietitians, can be instrumental in identifying patients with prostate cancer initiating ADT who are at risk for osteoporosis. Research on nutrition and lifestyle modification interventions to maintain bone health and reduce fracture risk for patients initiating ADT is limited. Additional research is required to develop and evaluate nutrition education interventions that will reduce the risk and prevent osteoporosis in men on ADT.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Loss of bone mineral density is an unintended consequence of androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer. Supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D in these men seems logical and is advocated by many lay and professional groups.

  METHODS: We reviewed guidelines for calcium and vitamin D supplementation and the results of clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.

  RESULTS: Whether supplementation of men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy with calcium and/or vitamin D results in higher bone mineral density than no supplementation has not been tested. The results of 12 clinical trials show that, at the doses commonly recommended, 500-1,000 mg calcium and 200-500 IU vitamin D per day, men undergoing androgen deprivation lose bone mineral density.

  CONCLUSION: The doses of calcium and vitamin D that have been tested are inadequate to prevent loss of bone mineral density in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy. In light of evidence that high levels of dietary calcium and calcium supplement use are associated with higher risks for cardiovascular disease and advanced prostate cancer, intervention studies should evaluate the safety as well as the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in these men.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to measure the impact of a patient education intervention aimed at increasing dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D in patients currently on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the treatment of prostate cancer.

  METHODS: Sixty-one participants attended a one-time dietitian-delivered group education session focusing on diet and lifestyle strategies to reduce the risk of bone loss while on ADT. Dietary intake was assessed using the diet history questionnaire at baseline and again at approximately 1 year post-intervention. Demographics, medical history (including comorbidities), awareness of developing bone loss while on ADT, and information resources utilized were recorded at baseline.

  RESULTS: Fifty-one participants completed both time points. Over one third of men did not meet minimum current clinical guidelines for calcium or vitamin D intake at baseline. Sixty-three percent of men reported they were aware that osteoporosis was a known side effect of ADT therapy. Only supplemental calcium intake was significantly increased after the intervention. Men aware of their risk of developing bone loss while on ADT reported higher baseline calcium intake (p < 0.05). Men undergoing ADT for less than 1 year at the time of intervention had significantly higher total calcium intake at follow-up compared to men on ADT for longer than 1 year (p = 0.038). Nonsignificant trends indicated that calcium and vitamin D intakes changed to a greater degree in those undergoing ADT for less than 1 year as well.

  CONCLUSIONS: Total calcium and vitamin D did not change significantly as a result of the intervention. Results suggest that promotion of dietary changes may be more effective if delivered closer to the initiation of therapy.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Claims have been made that sun protection may negatively affect vitamin D status, but very few data are available about whether this applies to people in uncontrolled settings.

  METHOD: In 1996 we measured 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations in 1113 adults in Nambour, a subtropical community, who reported their concurrent sun protection behaviours in a skin cancer prevention trial. Estimates were adjusted for time outdoors, vitamin D intake and other factors known to affect vitamin D status.

  RESULTS: Persons who tended to stay in the shade had lower vitamin D levels than those who never stayed in the shade (62.5 vs. 68.8 nmol/L respectively, p=0.01), and this association remained in persons who spent less than 50% (p=0.02) but not in those who spent more than 50% of their time outdoors. Wearing a hat, long sleeves, sunglasses and use of sunscreen or umbrella were not associated with vitamin D status after adjustments, including after stratification by time outdoors.

  CONCLUSION: Sun protection behaviour to reduce the risk of skin cancer can be maintained without affecting vitamin D serum status, although consistently seeking shade when spending less than 50% of daytime outdoors is associated with lower vitamin D levels.Copyright © 2012.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Recent studies suggest variation in genes along the vitamin D pathway, as well as vitamin D receptor (VDR) protein levels, may be associated with prostate cancer. As serum vitamin D levels vary by season, we sought to determine whether the expression of genes on the vitamin D pathway, assessed in prostate tumor tissue, do the same.

  METHODS: Our study incorporates mRNA expression data from 362 men in the Swedish Watchful Waiting cohort, diagnosed between 1977 and 1999, and 106 men enrolled in the US Physicians' Health Study (PHS) diagnosed between 1983 and 2004. We also assayed for VDR protein expression among 832 men in the PHS and Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts. Season was characterized by date of initial tissue specimen collection categorically and by average monthly ultraviolet radiation levels. One-way analysis of variance was used to examine variation in the expression levels of six genes on the vitamin D pathway-VDR, GC, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, RXRalpha, CYP24A1-and VDR protein by season, adjusted for age at diagnosis and Gleason grade. Variation was also examined separately among lethal and nonlethal cases.

  RESULTS: Tumor expression levels of the six genes did not vary significantly by season of tissue collection. No consistent patterns emerged from subgroup analyses by lethal versus nonlethal cases.

  CONCLUSIONS: Unlike circulating levels of 25(OH) vitamin D, expression levels of genes on the vitamin D pathway and VDR protein did not vary overall by season of tissue collection. Epidemiological analyses of vitamin D gene expression may not be biased by seasonality.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk of prostate cancer in relation to pre-diagnostic serum levels of vitamin D (25OHD(2) and 25OHD(3)), PTH, and calcium.

  METHODS: Nine hundred forty-three incident prostate cancer cases were identified in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study cohort, and each was matched with one control using incidence density matching with age as the underlying timescale. We also matched for calendar time and age at inclusion. Logistic regression analysis yielded odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals for different quartiles and deciles. All analyses were repeated stratified for age and body mass index (BMI).

  RESULTS: We found a weak trend toward increasing prostate cancer risk with rising vitamin D levels (p-trend across quartiles, 0.048). Dividing the cohort into deciles showed a nonlinear association. Compared to decile one, the prostate cancer risk was highest in deciles seven and eight, which corresponded to vitamin D levels of 91-97 nmol/L (1.68; 1.06-2.68), and 98-106 nmol/L (1.80; 1.13-2.85). In the other deciles, there was no association between prostate cancer risk and vitamin D levels. Albumin-adjusted calcium was positively associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer among men aged 55-65 with a BMI <25 (2.07; 1.08-3.97). No association was observed between pre-diagnostic PTH and subsequent prostate cancer incidence, and the stratified analyses revealed no other convincing relationships.

  CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a possible weak positive nonlinear association between vitamin D and the risk of prostate cancer.

Abstract
  Epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D protects against prostate cancer, although evidence is limited and inconsistent. We investigated associations of circulating total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) with prostate specific antigen-detected prostate cancer in a case-control study nested within the prostate testing for cancer and treatment (ProtecT) trial. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) quantifying the association between circulating total 25(OH)D and prostate cancer. In case-only analyses, we used unconditional logistic regression to quantify associations of total 25(OH)D with stage (advanced vs. localized) and Gleason grade (high-grade (>7) vs. low-grade (<7)). Predetermined categories of total 25(OH)D were defined as: high: >30 ng/mL; adequate: 20-<30 ng/mL; insufficient: 12-<20 ng/mL; deficient: <12 ng/mL. Fractional polynomials were used to investigate the existence of any U-shaped relationship. We included 1,447 prostate cancer cases (153 advanced, 469 high-grade) and 1,449 healthy controls. There was evidence that men deficient in vitamin D had a 2-fold increased risk of advanced versus localized cancer (OR for deficient vs. adequate total 25(OH)D=2.33, 95% CI: 1.26, 4.28) and high-grade versus low-grade cancer (OR for deficient vs. adequate total 25(OH)D=1.78, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.77). There was no evidence of a linear association between total 25(OH)D and prostate cancer (p=0.44) or of an increased risk of prostate cancer with high and low vitamin D levels. Our study provides evidence that lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with more aggressive cancers (advanced versus localized cancers and high- versus low-Gleason grade), but there was no evidence of an association with overall prostate cancer risk.Copyright © 2011 UICC.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: A small randomized controlled trial suggested that vitamin D might increase the production of testosterone in men, which is supported by experimental studies in animals and a cross-sectional study showing positive associations between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and testosterone and concordant seasonal variation of both biomarkers.

  DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: We investigated the cross-sectional association of plasma 25(OH)D levels and total and free testosterone measured by immunoassay in 1362 male participants of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study who were selected for a nested case-control study on prostate cancer using multivariate-adjusted linear and restricted cubic spline regression models.

  RESULTS: 25(OH)D was positively associated with total and free testosterone levels. From the lowest to the highest 25(OH)D quintile, multivariate-adjusted means (95% confidence interval) were 185 (177; 194), 194 (186; 202), 196 (188; 204), 201 (193; 209) and 200 (191; 208; P-trend = 0003) for total testosterone and 977 (939; 1015), 982 (941; 1022), 992 (952; 1032), 1007 (969; 1045) and 1015 (976; 1054; P-trend = 003) for free testosterone. The shapes of the dose-response curves indicate that the association between 25(OH)D and total and free testosterone is linear at lower levels of 25(OH)D (below approximately 75-85 nmol/l), reaching a plateau at higher levels. Unlike for 25(OH)D, we did not observe any seasonal variation of testosterone concentrations.

  CONCLUSION: This study supports previously reported positive associations between vitamin D and testosterone although we did not observe parallel seasonal variation patterns. Possible causality and direction of the vitamin D-testosterone association deserve further scientific investigation.Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The association of vitamin D status with prostate cancer is controversial; no association has been observed for overall incidence, but there is a potential link with lethal disease.

  METHODS: We assessed prediagnostic 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in plasma, variation in vitamin D-related genes, and risk of lethal prostate cancer using a prospective case-control study nested within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We included 1260 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer after providing a blood sample in 1993-1995 and 1331 control subjects. Men with prostate cancer were followed through March 2011 for lethal outcomes (n = 114). We selected 97 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genomic regions with high linkage disequilibrium (tagSNPs) to represent common genetic variation among seven vitamin D-related genes (CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, GC, CYP24A1, RXRA, and VDR). We used a logistic kernel machine test to assess whether multimarker SNP sets in seven vitamin D pathway-related genes were collectively associated with prostate cancer. Tests for statistical significance were two-sided.

  RESULTS: Higher 25(OH)D levels were associated with a 57% reduction in the risk of lethal prostate cancer (highest vs lowest quartile: odds ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval = 0.24 to 0.76). This finding did not vary by time from blood collection to diagnosis. We found no statistically significant association of plasma 25(OH)D levels with overall prostate cancer. Pathway analyses found that the set of SNPs that included all seven genes (P = .008) as well as sets of SNPs that included VDR (P = .01) and CYP27A1 (P = .02) were associated with risk of lethal prostate cancer.

  CONCLUSION: In this prospective study, plasma 25(OH)D levels and common variation among several vitamin D-related genes were associated with lethal prostate cancer risk, suggesting that vitamin D is relevant for lethal prostate cancer.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) may protect against prostate and other cancers. Few epidemiology studies have measured 25(OH)D on all participants, weakening the evidence-base through reduced statistical power and the potential for bias. We developed a score to predict individual 25(OH)D based on potential predictors, including sun exposure, nutrient intake, and vitamin D pathway genes, providing a method of substituting missing values. We assessed the usefulness of predicted 25(OH)D by comparison with multiple imputation of 25(OH)D levels.

  METHODS: Amongst 1,091 controls from a population-based case-control study (ProtecT), we quantified relationships of sun exposure, demographic, clinical, anthropologic, nutrient, and genetic data with circulating 25(OH)D and constructed several prediction scores from subsets of these measures. We investigated associations of three prostate cancer risk factors (PSA level, BMI, family history of prostate cancer) with 25(OH)D levels in sensitivity analyses based upon participants with measured 25(OH)D only and based upon the addition of all participants with missing 25(OH)D levels substituted by prediction score values or by multiple imputation.

  RESULTS: Our score accounted for 27.7% of the variation in measured 25(OH)D. Associations with risk factors of prostate cancer were consistent across the different estimates of 25(OH)D. However, standard deviations for the prediction score did not incorporate extra error from prediction. Multiple imputation of missing 25(OH)D values predicted a more realistic range of 25(OH)D.

  CONCLUSION: In epidemiological studies of cancer risk associated with vitamin D, multiple imputation of missing 25(OH)D is preferable to prediction scores, as a wider range of 25(OH)D levels are imputed and appropriate confidence intervals calculated.

Abstract
  Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (PC) in epidemiologic and prospective studies. An association has also been made between high dietary calcium and increased PC risk. In this study, we evaluated the effect of dietary vitamin D and calcium on the growth of human androgen-insensitive prostate tumor in an athymic mouse model. We observed highest tumor growth in the normal calcium - vitamin D-deficient group, while tumor growth between the normal calcium - vitamin D-sufficient, high calcium - vitamin D-sufficient and high calcium - vitamin D-deficient diet-groups did not significantly differ but was significantly lower than that in the normal calcium - vitamin D-deficient group. Our results suggest an important role of dietary vitamin D as a preventive agent in androgen-insensitive PC.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy undergo a rapid decline in bone mineral density during the first 6 to 12 months of initiating therapy. The World Health Organization has developed and implemented the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) to predict the ten year risk of a major fracture & hip fracture. Additionally, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the National Osteoporosis Foundation have developed osteoporosis guidelines. This study aims to characterize the fracture risk (based on the FRAX tool) and the current management of bone health based on national guidelines compliance.

  METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients receiving a LHRH agonist at our institution was conducted. Data collection commenced upon Institutional Review Board approval and included demographics, past medical history, medication regimen, history of androgen deprivation therapy, bone health and its management. The ten year fracture risk calculated with the collected information using the FRAX tool.

  RESULTS: A total of 174 subjects included with a mean age of 65.5 years, 71.8% had stage II prostate cancer, 97.7% received the LHRH agonist leuprolide for a mean of 13.8 +/- 18.1 months. In addition to ADT, 57% of patients had > 2 risk factors for developing osteoporosis. The risk of sustaining a major fracture increased from 4% to 5.6% after the initiation of ADT (P = <0.001). The risk for sustaining a hip fracture rose from 1.3% to 2.2% (P = <0.001). National guideline compliance was found to be 9%, 5% and 3% respectively for obtaining Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans, calcium supplementation, and vitamin D supplementation.

  CONCLUSION: In addition to predisposing risk factors for osteoporosis, ADT significantly increases the fracture risk in the prostate cancer population. There is room for improvement in the management of bone health as some intervention could have been made in over 90% of patients evaluated.

Abstract
  The active form of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D], interacts with vitamin D receptor (VDR) and induces antiproliferative, anti-invasive, proapoptotic and pro-differentiation activities in prostate cancer cells. Three cytochrome P-450 (CYP) hydroxylases are responsible for vitamin D synthesis and degradation, including vitamin D-25-hydroxylase (25-OHase) in the liver, and 25(OH)D-1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-OHase) or CYP27B1, and 25(OH)D-24-hydroxylase (24-OHase) or CYP24A1 in the kidneys. However, it is now recognized that CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 are also expressed in many tissues and cells, including the prostate. Although at least six CYP enzymes have been identified with 25-OHase activity, the two major ones are CYP27A1 and CYP2R1, and both are expressed in the prostate, with CYP2R1 as the predominate type. This indicates that prostate tissue has the ability to activate and inactivate vitamin D in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. Recent evidence indicates that 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and its analogs can bind to VDR as agonists, without converting them to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D or the corresponding 1alpha-hydroxylated metabolites, to modulate gene expressions that will lead to cell growth arrest and other antitumor activities. This finding suggests that the circulating levels of 25(OH)D, and the autocrine synthesis of 25(OH)D may play an important role in regulating the growth of prostate cancer. Thus, in addition to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D analogs, the presence of CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in the prostate suggests that the analogs of vitamin D and 25(OH)D, especially those that are resistant to CYP24A1 degradation, can be developed and used for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Low serum levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (1,25D), have been associated with aggressive biologic behavior of prostate cancer (PCa). In the present study, we examined the effects of 1,25D and its novel, low-calcemic analog ZK191784 (ZK) on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as well as on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein levels in human PCa cell lines LNCaP and DU-145.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were incubated with either vehicle (control), 1,25D or ZK. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity was determined by gelatin zymography, while ICAM-1 levels were assessed by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry.

  RESULTS: Compared to the controls, 1,25D and ZK caused a marked dose-dependent decrease in the gelatinolytic activity of the MMPs under study, particularly when ZK was used. Likewise, ICAM-1 was down-regulated in the cells incubated with 1,25D or ZK.

  CONCLUSION: Vitamin D analogs appear to be involved in the regulation of extracellular MMP activity and membrane adhesion molecule expression. Further studies, both in vitro and in vivo, are needed to define their role as potential therapeutic tools.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of vitamin D levels and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among US men.

  MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were analyzed for 2387 men (>20 years) who participated in the 2005-2006 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. LUTS included nocturia, incomplete emptying, hesitancy, and urinary incontinence (UI). Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D was categorized as >30 ng/mL (normal), 20-30 ng/mL (insufficiency), and <20 ng/mL (deficiency). Other factors included age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, self-reported health status, chronic diseases, and prior diagnosis of benign prostatic enlargement and/or prostate cancer (men >40 years of age). Prevalence and prevalence odds ratios (POR) were estimated from a multivariable logistic regression analysis using appropriate sampling weights.

  RESULTS: A majority (89%, n = 1241) had vitamin D levels <30 ng/mL, of whom 55% (n = 684) had vitamin D levels <20 ng/mL. Vitamin D levels ranged from 2-56 ng/mL (median 19 ng/mL, mean +/- SD 19.9 +/- 8.0). Among the 1388 (58%) men with LUTS data and vitamin D levels, 48% (n = 666) had at least 1 LUTS. In multivariable analyses adjusting for age and race norms, vitamin D deficiency was associated with the presence of moderate-severe UI (POR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.0) and at least 1 LUTS (POR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0, 2.0).

  CONCLUSION: Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are highly prevalent among adult men in the US, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with moderate-severe UI and the presence of at least 1 LUTS.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Increased sun exposure and blood levels of vitamin D have been postulated to be protective against prostate cancer. This is controversial. We investigated the relationship between prostate cancer incidence and solar radiation in non-urban Australia, and found a lower incidence in regions receiving more sunlight. In landmark ecological studies, prostate cancer mortality rates have been shown to be inversely related to ultraviolet radiation exposure. Investigators have hypothesised that ultraviolet radiation acts by increasing production of vitamin D, which inhibits prostate cancer cells in vitro. However, analyses of serum levels of vitamin D in men with prostate cancer have failed to support this hypothesis. This study has found an inverse correlation between solar radiation and prostate cancer incidence in Australia. Our population (previously unstudied) represents the third group to exhibit this correlation. Significantly, the demographics and climate of Australia differ markedly from those of previous studies conducted on men in the United Kingdom and the United States.

  OBJECTIVE: * To ascertain if prostate cancer incidence rates correlate with solar radiation among non-urban populations of men in Australia.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Local government areas from each state and territory were selected using explicit criteria. Urban areas were excluded from analysis. * For each local government area, prostate cancer incidence rates and averaged long-term solar radiation were obtained. * The strength of the association between prostate cancer incidence and solar radiation was determined.

  RESULTS: * Among 70 local government areas of Australia, age-standardized prostate cancer incidence rates for the period 1998-2007 correlated inversely with daily solar radiation averaged over the last two decades.

  CONCLUSION: *  There exists an association between less solar radiation and higher prostate cancer incidence in Australia.Copyright © 2011 THE AUTHORS. BJU INTERNATIONAL © 2011 BJU INTERNATIONAL.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dietary calcium intake (DCI) and vitamin D serum concentrations in patients with prostate cancer.

  METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including 91 subjects with prostate cancer. We determined DCI by a questionnaire, 25 OH vitamin D levels and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

  RESULTS: According to current guidelines (1000 mg/day), calcium intake was low in patients with prostate cancer (394+/-201 mg/day). Twenty-two percent (20) of patients had adequate levels of vitamin D, whereas 29.7% (27) of patients were vitamin D deficient and 48.3% (44) were classified as vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D levels were not different in patients with or without androgen-deprivation therapy. There were no correlation between DCI, 25 OH vitamin and BMD.

  CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in our group of prostate cancer patients DCI was low and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Although this is a common condition in other populations, in this group of patients especially prone to osteoporosis could have more relevance. Additional research is needed to establish the consequences of low calcium intake and vitamin D deficiency in prostate cancer patients.Copyright © 2011 SEEN. Published by Elsevier Espana.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to evaluate the changes of bone mineral density (BMD), incidence of pathological fractures and to asses the effect of bisphosphonate therapy in prostate cancer patients (PCa) on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with the use of LHRH.

  METHODS: In this prospective study bone mass density (BMD) was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 97 PCa patients and 89 patients of compared group. DXA was examined at baseline and patients in the study group were subjected to ADT. PCa patients with osteoporosis were treated by calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonate and the subsequent DXA was made after 10 months. All other PCa patients (non-osteoporotic) had DXA examined every 12-14 months.

  RESULTS: Patients of the study group had significantly lower baseline L1-L4 and total hip BMD (p=0.028, p=0.022). BMD was significantly lower in L1-L4 and total hip (p=0.004, p<0.001, resp.) after 10-14 months and in L1-L4, femoral neck, and total hip (p=0.001, p=0.037, p< 0.001, resp.) after 20-26 months of ADT. After the treatment for osteoporosis with bisphosphonate a significant increase of BMD (p=0.04) was found in a total of 23 patients. Overall, the incidence of fractures after 20-26 months of ADT was 8.5 %.

  CONCLUSIONS: Osteopenia is very common in hormone naive PCa patients. There was a significant loss of BMD after 12 months of ADT which was progressive while the patients were on ADT. Bisphosphonate therapy was effective after 20 months of treatment. The incidence of pathological fractures was 7-fold higher in the study group.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Epidemiological, molecular, and cellular studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for the development and/or progression of PCa. Studies using cell culture systems and animal models suggest that vitamin D acts to reduce the growth of PCa through regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, although preclinical studies provide a strong indication for anti-cancer activity, proof of therapeutic benefits in men is still lacking. The anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating properties of vitamin D have been attributed to calcitriol [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], the hormonally active form of vitamin D, acting through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Metabolism of vitamin D in target tissues is mediated by two key enzymes: 1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), which catalyzes the synthesis of calcitriol from 25(OH)D and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24), which catalyzes the initial step in the conversion of calcitriol to less active metabolites. Many factors affect the balance of calcitriol synthesis and catabolism and several maneuvers, like combination therapy of calcitriol with other drugs, have been explored to treat PCa and reduce its risk. The current paper is an overview addressing some of the key factors that influence the biological actions of vitamin D and its metabolites in the treatment and/or prevention of PCa.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Many studies have demonstrated the relationship between vitamin D and cancer of many different sites, including of the breast, colorectum, prostate and lung. Most epidemiological studies have assessed the effects of dietary intake only, although endogenous production after sun exposure is the main source of vitamin D. The aim of our pilot study was to study serum levels of vitamin D in general population and in patients with different type of cancer.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: The control group consisted of 214 healthy individuals. Pathological groups of patients included 170 patients with different cancer types (28 patients with prostate cancer, 43 patients with breast cancer, 49 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 patients with lung cancer). All of the patients were enrolled in the early clinical stage of cancer up to clinical stage III. Advanced stages were not included into the study. Vitamin D serum levels were measured using ECLIA Roche method.

  RESULTS: All the results for serum vitamin D from pathological groups were significantly lower compared to the levels of the control group. All the cancer types had a high incidence rate of very low serum levels of vitamin D. Lung cancer had the highest incidence rate of very low vitamin D serum levels.

  CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of hypovitaminosis D in cancer patients compared to a healthy control group among a Czech population. This incidence rate is higher in comparison to data found in literature from the other parts of the world. Based on the data from this study, a large epidemiological study monitoring vitamin D serum levels in the healthy population and in cancer patients in the Czech Republic has been already proposed.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vitamin D compounds inhibit prostate tumorigenesis experimentally, but epidemiologic data are inconsistent with respect to prostate cancer risk, with some studies suggesting nonsignificant positive associations.

  METHODS: The 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D]-prostate cancer relation was examined in a nested case-control study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study of 50- to 69-year-old Finnish men. We matched 1,000 controls to 1,000 cases diagnosed during up to 20 years of follow-up on the basis of age (+/-1 year) and fasting blood collection date (+/-30 days). Conditional multivariate logistic regression models estimated ORs and 95% CIs. All statistical significance testing was 2-sided.

  RESULTS: Cases had nonsignificantly 3% higher serum 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.19). ORs (95% CIs) for increasing season-specific quintiles of 25(OH)D concentrations were 1.00 (reference), 1.29 (0.95-1.74), 1.34 (1.00-1.80), 1.26 (0.93-1.72), and 1.56 (1.15-2.12), with P(trend) = 0.01. Analyses based on prespecified clinical categories and season-adjusted values yielded similar results. These findings seemed stronger for aggressive disease [OR (95% CI) for fifth quintile of serum 25(OH)D [1.70 (1.05-2.76), P(trend) = 0.02], among men with greater physical activity [1.85 (1.26-2.72), P(trend) = 0.002], higher concentrations of serum total cholesterol [2.09 (1.36-3.21), P(trend) = 0.003] or alpha-tocopherol [2.00 (1.30-3.07), P(trend) = 0.01] and higher intakes of total calcium [1.82 (1.20-2.76), P(trend) = 0.01] or vitamin D [1.69 (1.04-2.75), P(trend) = 0.08], or among those who had received the trial alpha-tocopherol supplements [1.74 (1.15-2.64), P(trend) = 0.006].

  CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that men with higher vitamin D blood levels are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer.

  IMPACT: Greater caution is warranted with respect to recommendations for high-dose vitamin D supplementation and higher population target blood levels.

Abstract
  The optimal approach to vitamin D supplementation for the average healthy person is debatable. In patients with cancer, the role of vitamin D supplementation, possibly in treatment, is even less clear. Vitamin D is shown to play a role in prostate cancer biology; however, the clinical data have not consistently demonstrated a link. Additional studies are needed to determine if higher doses of vitamin D supplements could benefit selected populations (ie, the elderly or patients with cancer) even if they may not be beneficial for the general population.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Surgical or chemical castration is widely used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Common side effects of castration are e.g. sweating, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, impotency and anemia. Castration increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in prostate cancer patients via hormonal effects to the bone. Castrated men should be recommended to increase physical activity. Calcium and vitamin-D supplementation is recommended. The European Association of Urology guidelines for prostate cancer recommend bone mineral density measurements before long-lasting castration therapy. Medical therapy should be considered for patients after low-energy fractures, after the diagnosis of osteoporosis based on bone mineral density measurements and for fracture high-risk patients based on clinical decision.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: There is evidence from epidemiological and in vitro studies that the biological effects of testosterone (T) on cell cycle and survival are modulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in prostate cancer. To investigate the cross talk between androgen- and vitamin D-mediated intracellular signaling pathways, the individual and combined effects of T and 1,25(OH)2D3 on global gene expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells were assessed.

  RESULTS: Stringent statistical analysis identifies a cohort of genes that lack one or both androgen response elements (AREs) or vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in their promoters, which are nevertheless differentially regulated by both steroids (either additively or synergistically). This suggests that mechanisms in addition to VDR- and AR-mediated transcription are responsible for the modulation of gene expression. Microarray analysis shows that fifteen miRNAs are also differentially regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and T. Among these miR-22, miR-29ab, miR-134, miR-1207-5p and miR-371-5p are up regulated, while miR-17 and miR-20a, members of the miR-17/92 cluster are down regulated. A number of genes implicated in cell cycle progression, lipid synthesis and accumulation and calcium homeostasis are among the mRNA targets of these miRNAs. Thus, in addition to their well characterized effects on transcription, mediated by either or both cognate nuclear receptors, 1,25(OH)2D3 and T regulate the steady state mRNA levels by modulating miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation, generating attenuation feedback loops that result in global changes in mRNA and protein levels. Changes in genes involved in calcium homeostasis may have specific clinical importance since the second messenger Ca2+ is known to modulate various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell death and cell motility, which affects prostate cancer tumor progression and responsiveness to therapy.

  CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that these two hormones combine to drive a differentiated phenotype, and reinforce the idea that the age dependent decline in both hormones results in the de-differentiation of prostate tumor cells, which results in increased proliferation, motility and invasion common to aggressive tumors. These studies also reinforce the potential importance of miRNAs in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Data suggest that circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis for some malignancies, although evidence for prostate cancer is less clear. How VDR expression in tumor tissue may influence prostate cancer progression has not been evaluated in large studies.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined protein expression of VDR in tumor tissue among 841 patients with prostate cancer in relation to risk of lethal prostate cancer within two prospective cohorts, the Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. We also examined the association of VDR expression with prediagnostic circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and with two VDR single nucleotide polymorphisms, FokI and BsmI.

  RESULTS: Men whose tumors had high VDR expression had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis (P for trend < .001), lower Gleason score (P for trend < .001), and less advanced tumor stage (P for trend < .001) and were more likely to have tumors harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (P for trend = .009). Compared with the lowest quartile, men whose tumors had the highest VDR expression had significantly reduced risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.41). This association was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for Gleason score and PSA at diagnosis (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.83) or, additionally, for tumor stage (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.94). Neither prediagnostic plasma vitamin D levels nor VDR polymorphisms were associated with VDR expression.

  CONCLUSION: High VDR expression in prostate tumors is associated with a reduced risk of lethal cancer, suggesting a role of the vitamin D pathway in prostate cancer progression.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is considered as an important determinant of bone turnover as well as cancer growth. Using a murine model of bone metastasis, we investigated the effect of vitamin D deficiency on prostate cancer cell growth in bone.

  METHODS: Three-week-old male nude mice were fed either normal chow (control) or a diet deficient in vitamin D. The latter diet resulted in severe hypovitaminosis D within 6 weeks. At this point of time, 5x10(4) cells of the prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, were injected either into the bone marrow (tibia) or subcutaneously into soft tissues. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) was co-administered in subgroups of mice to suppress bone remodeling. Osteolytic lesions were monitored by serial X-ray, while soft tissue tumor growth was measured by caliper. All tissues were analyzed by micro-CT and histology at endpoint.

  RESULTS: Bone turnover was significantly accelerated in vitamin D deficient compared to vitamin D sufficient mice from week 6 onwards. Intra-tibially implanted PC-3 cells resulted in mixed osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesion. At endpoint, osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesion areas, total tumor area, and tumor mitotic activity were all significantly increased in vitamin D deficient mice compared to controls. Regardless of diet, OPG reduced bone turnover, total tumor, and osteosclerotic area as well as tumor mitotic activity, while promoting cell apoptosis. In contrast, vitamin D deficiency did not alter tumor growth in soft tissues.

  CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency stimulates prostate cancer growth in bone through modulating the bone microenvironment.Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Laboratory evidence suggests that vitamin D might influence prostate cancer prognosis.

  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the associations between prediagnostic plasma levels of 25(OH)vitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D] and mortality among 1822 participants of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study who were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total mortality (n = 595) and lethal prostate cancer (death from prostate cancer or development of bone metastases; n = 202). In models adjusted for age at diagnosis, BMI, physical activity, and smoking, we observed a HR of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.54) for total mortality, comparing men in the lowest to the highest quartile of 25(OH)D. There was no association between 1,25(OH)(2)D and total mortality. Men with the lowest 25(OH)D quartile were more likely to die of their cancer (HR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.39) compared to those in the highest quartile (P(trend) = 0.006). This association was largely explained by the association between low 25(OH)D levels and advanced cancer stage and higher Gleason score, suggesting that these variables may mediate the influence of 25(OH)D on prognosis. The association also tended to be stronger among patients with samples collected within five years of cancer diagnosis. 1,25(OH)(2)D levels were not associated with lethal prostate cancer.

  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although potential bias of less advanced disease due to more screening activity among men with high 25(OH)D levels cannot be ruled out, higher prediagnostic plasma 25(OH)D might be associated with improved prostate cancer prognosis.

Abstract
  It is well-known that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and analogs exert anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating effects and these compounds have therefore been proposed to be of potential use as anti-cancer agents. Due to its effects on aromatase gene expression and enzyme activity, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) has been proposed as an interesting substance in breast cancer treatment and prevention. In the present study, we have examined the effects of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) on estrogen and androgen metabolism in adrenocortical NCI-H295R cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells and prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The NCI-H295R cell line has been proposed as a screening tool to study endocrine disruptors. We therefore studied whether this cell line reacted to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment in the same way as cells from important endocrine target tissues. 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) exerted cell line-specific effects on estrogen and androgen metabolism. In breast cancer MCF-7 cells, aromatase gene expression and estradiol production were decreased, while production of androgens was markedly increased. In NCI-H295R cells, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) stimulated aromatase expression and decreased dihydrotestosterone production. In prostate cancer LNCaP cells, aromatase expression increased after the same treatment, as did production of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In summary, our data show that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) exerts tissue-specific effects on estrogen and androgen production and metabolism. This is important knowledge about 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) as an interesting substance for further research in the field of breast cancer prevention and treatment. Furthermore, the observed cell line-specific effects are of importance in the discussion about NCI-H295R cells as a model for effects on estrogen and androgen metabolism.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed literature examining associations of vitamin D (dietary intake, circulating 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D (25(OH)D), and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D (1,25(OH)(2)D) concentrations) with prostate cancer.

  METHODS: We searched over 24,000 papers from seven electronic databases (to October 2010) for exposures related to vitamin D. We conducted dose-response random-effects meta-analyses pooling the log odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per change in natural units of each exposure. The I(2) statistic quantified between-study variation due to heterogeneity.

  RESULTS: Twenty-five papers were included. In prospective studies, the OR per 1,000 IU increase in dietary intake was 1.14 (6 studies; CI: 0.99, 1.31; I (2) = 0%) for total prostate cancer and 0.93 (3 studies; 0.63, 1.39; I (2) = 25%) for aggressive prostate cancer. Five case-control studies examined dietary intake, but there was a high degree of inconsistency between studies (I (2) = 49%). The OR per 10 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D was 1.04 (14 studies; 0.99, 1.10; I (2) = 0%) for total prostate cancer and 0.98 (6 studies; 0.84, 1.15; I (2) = 32%) for aggressive prostate cancer. The OR per 10 pg/mL increase in 1,25(OH)(2)D was 1.00 (7 studies; 0.87, 1.14; I (2) = 41%) for total prostate cancer and 0.86 (2 studies; 0.72, 1.02; I (2) = 0%) for aggressive prostate cancer.

  CONCLUSION: Published literature provides little evidence to support a major role of vitamin D in preventing prostate cancer or its progression.

Abstract
  Because an inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and the risk of prostate cancer has been suggested, it was hypothesized that vitamin D insufficiency would be common in patients with prostate cancer. To test the hypothesis, an exploratory study was conducted to examine serum 25(OH)D levels in a cohort of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. The study aim was to assess the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in these patients. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/L. Serum 25(OH)D levels measured prospectively at baseline and, then, yearly during a 5-year follow-up were analyzed. Various parameters were examined to assess their possible association with vitamin D insufficiency at baseline, using both a univariate analysis and a logistic regression model. Analyses including descriptive statistics for all variables were carried out with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A total of 106 patients were available for analysis. The median age was 66.3 years. At baseline, mean and median vitamin D level was 72.4 and 70.0 nmol/L, respectively. Sixty-four patients (60.4%) met the definition of vitamin D insufficiency with serum 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/L. Forty (37.7%), 20 (18.9%), and 2 patients (1.9%) had serum 25(OH)D less than 62.5, less than 50, and less than 25 nmol/L, respectively. On a logistic regression model, season was the only significant variable associated with vitamin D insufficiency. Of a total 477 serum 25(OH)D measurements from the baseline and yearly follow-ups, 187 (39.2%) met the definition of vitamin D insufficiency. In conclusion, vitamin D insufficiency was prevalent among patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Adhesion of circulating prostate cancer (PCa) cells to the microvascular endothelium is a critical step during cancer metastasis. To study PCa cell rolling and adhesion behavior, we developed a dynamic flow-based microtube system to mimic the microvascular environment. We found that PCa cell rolling capacity is mediated by E-selectin and can be enhanced by stromal cell-derived factor-1 under different wall shear stresses. Using this device, we tested if the chemopreventive agent, vitamin D, could interfere with PCa cell adhesion. We found that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD), the bioactive form of vitamin D, reduced PCa cell rolling numbers and increased rolling velocities resulting in a significant decreased number of PCa cells adhering to the microtube. The inhibitory effects of 1,25-VD on PCa cell heterotypic adhesion were further confirmed using microvascular endothelial cells in a static condition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 1,25-VD can increase E-cadherin expression in PCa cells and promote the homotypic cell-cell aggregation, which can then hinder PCa cell adhesion to the endothelium. Blocking E-cadherin with a neutralizing antibody can reverse 1,25-VD-mediated suppression of PCa cell adhesion to the endothelium. Taken together, our data revealed that 1,25-VD promoted PCa cell aggregation by increasing E-cadherin expression, thus interfering with circulating PCa cell adhesion to microvascular endothelial cells and potentially reducing their metastatic potential.Copyright © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Abstract
  Epidemiological studies have suggested a reduced risk of several cancers associated with high vitamin D status. We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses of observational studies of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and colorectal, breast and prostate cancer and colonic adenoma. The literature of December 2009 was searched without language restriction. The meta-regression analysis was done to compute dose-response effects. Because in case-control studies, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is measured after the diagnosis of cancer, separate analyses for case-control and prospective studies were done. We identified 35 independent studies. The seven studies on colorectal adenomas were heterogeneous in terms of endpoint and control for major confounding factors, and we did not perform a meta-analysis of these data. The summary relative risk (SRR) and (95% confidence interval) for a 10 ng/ml increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 0.85 (0.79; 0.91) for colorectal cancer (2,630 cases in 9 studies); 0.89 (0.81;0.98) for breast cancer (6,175 cases in 10 studies); and 0.99 (0.95;1.03) for prostate cancer (3,956 cases in 11 studies). For breast cancer, case-control studies (3,030 cases) had major limitations and obtained SRR of 0.83 (0.79; 0.87) whereas SRR of prospective studies (3,145 cases) was 0.97 (0.92; 1.03). For colorectal and breast cancer, differences between cases and controls in the season of blood draw or in overweight/obesity or physical inactivity could not explain the results. In conclusion, a consistent inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and colorectal cancer was found. No association was found for breast and prostate cancer.Copyright © 2010 UICC.

Abstract
  Bone health in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has gained increased attention in recent years. Therapies that are becoming available to prevent bone loss and associated complications are changing practice for this patient population. In addition to basic vitamin D and calcium supplementation, bisphosphonates may be an option to treat these patients, and denosumab, a receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand inhibitor, has been proven to be effective in preventing bone loss through a randomized clinical trial. This review examines the importance of bone health in patients on ADT, with an overview of available treatment modalities and guidelines for managing these patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data suggest that there is an association between vitamin D deficiency and influenza infection. We conducted a prospective influenza vaccination study to determine the influence of vitamin D status on serological response to influenza vaccine in prostate cancer (CaP) patients.

  METHODS: During the 2006-2007 influenza season, CaP patients treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute were offered vaccination with the trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone, 2006-2007) and sera collected for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay titers before and 3 months after vaccination. Response to vaccination was defined as >1:40 titer ratio or a fourfold increase in titer at 3 months, against any of the three strains. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-D3) levels were measured using DiaSorin 125I radioimmunoassay kits.

  RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with CaP participated in the study. Median baseline 25-D3 level was 44.88ng/ml (range: 9.16-71.98ng/ml) Serological response against any of the three strains was noted in 80%. There was a significant effect of baseline 25-D3 level when tested as a continuous variable in relation to serological response (P=0.0446). All patients in the upper quartile of 25-D3 level responded by mounting a serological response (P=0.0344). None of the other baseline variables (age, race, chemotherapy status, or white cell count) had an effect on serological response.

  CONCLUSIONS: In this study in CaP patients, a replete vitamin D status was associated with more frequent serological response to influenza vaccine.Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The association between vitamin D and prostate biopsy outcomes has not been evaluated. We examine serum vitamin D levels with prostate biopsy results in men with an abnormal prostate-specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination.

  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) was obtained from 667 men, ages 40 to 79 years, prospectively enrolled from Chicago urology clinics undergoing first prostate biopsy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between 25-OH D status and incident prostate cancer, Gleason score, and tumor stage.

  RESULTS: Among European American (EA) men, there was an association of 25-OH D <12 ng/mL with higher Gleason score > 4+4 [OR, 3.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.41-9.50; P = 0.008] and tumor stage [stage > cT2b vs. < cT2a, OR, 2.42 (1.14-5.10); P = 0.008]. In African American (AA) men, we find increased odds of prostate cancer diagnosis on biopsy with 25-OH D < 20 ng/mL [OR, 2.43 (1.20-4.94); P = 0.01]. AA men demonstrated an association between 25-OH D < 12 ng/mL and Gleason > 4+4 [OR, 4.89 (1.59-15.07); P = 0.006]. There was an association with tumor stage > cT2b vs. < cT2a [OR, 4.22 (1.52-11.74); P = 0.003].

  CONCLUSIONS: In AA men, vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased odds of prostate cancer diagnosis on biopsy. In both EA and AA men, severe deficiency was positively associated with higher Gleason grade and tumor stage.Copyright ©2014 AACR.

Abstract
  Vitamin D has antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and apoptotic properties. There is some evidence supporting an association between vitamin D-related gene variants and prostate cancer risk. We report results from this population-based case-control study of genes encoding for the vitamin D receptor (VDR), the vitamin D activating enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), and deactivating enzyme 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1). Forty-eight tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNP) were analyzed in 827 incident prostate cancer cases diagnosed from 2002 to 2005, and in 787 age-matched controls. Contrary to some earlier studies, we found no strong evidence of altered risk of developing prostate cancer overall or within clinical measures of tumor aggressiveness for any of the tagSNPs when they were assessed individually or in haplotypes.

Abstract
  We systematically investigated the association of 48 SNPS in four vitamin D metabolizing genes [CYP27A1, GC, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1] with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D] levels and the association of these SNPS and an additional 164 SNPS in eight downstream mediators of vitamin D signaling [VDR, RXRA, RXRB, PPAR, NCOA1, NCOA2, NCOA3 and SMAD3] with prostate cancer risk in the 749 incident prostate cancer cases and 781 controls of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. 25(OH)D (all cases and controls) and 1,25(OH)(2)D (a subset of 150 controls) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay and SNP data were genotyped as part of a genome-wide scan. Among investigated SNPS, only four tag SNPS in GC, the major serum 25(OH)D carrier, were associated with 25(OH)D levels; no SNPS were associated with 1,25(OH)(2)D levels. None of the 212 SNPS examined were associated with cancer risk overall. Among men in the lowest tertile of serum 25(OH)D (<48.9 nmol/l), however, prostate cancer risk was related to tag SNPS in or near the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of VDR, with the strongest association for rs11574143 [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for risk allele carriers versus wild-type: 2.49 (1.51-4.11), P = 0.0007]; the genotype associations were null among men in tertile 2 and tertile 3. Results from the most comprehensive evaluation of serum vitamin D and its related genes to date suggest that tag SNPS in the 3' UTR of VDR may be associated with risk of prostate cancer in men with low vitamin D status.

Abstract
  Calcium and dairy foods in relation to prostate cancer were examined in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study (1995/1996-2001). Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Multivariate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by Cox regression. During up to 6 years of follow-up (n = 293,888), the authors identified 10,180 total prostate cancer cases (8,754 nonadvanced, 1,426 advanced, and 178 fatal cases). Total and supplemental calcium were unrelated to total and nonadvanced prostate cancer. However, a statistically nonsignificant positive association with total calcium was observed for advanced (> or = 2,000 vs. 500-<750 mg/day: relative risk (RR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 1.71; p(trend) = 0.06) and fatal (> or = 1,000 vs. 500-<750 mg/day: RR = 1.39, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.09; p(trend) = 0.10) prostate cancer. Skim milk, but not other dairy foods, was associated with increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (> or = 2 vs. zero servings/day: RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.54; p(trend) = 0.01). In contrast, calcium from nondairy foods was associated with lower risk of nonadvanced prostate cancer (> or = 600 vs. < 250 mg/day: RR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.99; p(trend) = 0.04). Although the authors cannot definitively rule out a weak association for aggressive prostate cancer, their findings do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that calcium and dairy foods increase prostate cancer risk.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have reported inconsistent associations of vitamin D and prostate cancer risk; however, few have adequately controlled for detection bias related to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, and the results of many studies may be affected by occult prostate cancers among controls.

  METHODS: Data for this nested case-control analysis (n = 1,695 cases/1,682 controls) are from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Baseline serum was analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The presence or absence of cancer was subsequently determined by prostate biopsy. Polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of 25(OH)D with risk of total, Gleason 2-6, Gleason 7, and Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer. Results are presented for placebo and finasteride arms separately and combined.

  RESULTS: There were no associations of serum 25(OH)D with total prostate cancer risk. For Gleason 2-6 cancers, results were inconsistent across treatment arms with a suggestion of increased risk in the placebo arm only; however, there was no dose-response relationship. For Gleason 8-10 prostate cancers, 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a linear decrease in risk among combined treatment arms [quartile 4 vs. 1: OR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.32-0.94; P(trend) = 0.04]. These findings were somewhat stronger among men >65 versus 55-64 years at baseline (quartile 4 vs. 1: OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.88 vs. OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.35-1.52, respectively; P(interaction) = 0.52).

  CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum 25(OH)D may modestly increase risk of Gleason 2-6 disease and more substantially reduce risk of Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer.

  IMPACT: Vitamin D may have different effects for different stages of prostate cancers.Copyright ©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In vitro, animal, and ecological studies suggest that inadequate vitamin D intake could increase prostate cancer risk, but results of biomarker-based longitudinal studies are inconsistent.

  METHODS: Data for this case (n = 1,731) and cohort (n = 3,203) analysis are from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test whether baseline plasma vitamin D (25-hydroxy) concentration, adjusted for season of blood collection, was associated with the risk of total and Gleason score 2-6, 7-10, and 8-10 prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: There were U-shaped associations of vitamin D with total cancer risk: compared with the first quintile, HRs were 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-1.03; P = 0.092], 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59-0.92; P = 0.008), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.69-1.07; P = 0.181), and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78-1.21; P = 0.823), for the second through fifth quintiles, respectively. For Gleason 7-10 cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.45-0.90; P = 0.010), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.47-0.92; P = 0.016), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.56-1.10; P = 0.165), and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.63-1.22; P = 0.436). Among African American men (n = 250 cases), higher vitamin D was associated with reduced risk of Gleason 7-10 cancer only: in the a posteriori contrast of quintiles 1-2 versus 3-5, the HR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = 0.037), with no evidence of dose-response or a U-shaped association.

  CONCLUSIONS: Both low and high vitamin D concentrations were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, and more strongly for high-grade disease.

Abstract
  In a search for improved therapies for prostate cancer, we investigated the effect of genistein in combination with 1alpha-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], on the growth of DU145 human prostate cancer cells. DU145 cells were very resistant to the growth inhibitory action of 1,25(OH)2D3 or genistein when administered individually. However, the combination caused a significant growth inhibition seen at lower concentrations of both agents. 1,25(OH)2D3 induces the expression of the CYP24 gene, which codes for the enzyme that initiates the catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3. We showed for the first time that genistein at low doses (50-100 nM) directly inhibited CYP24 at the enzyme level. Addition of genistein to mitochondrial preparations inhibited CYP24 enzyme activity in a noncompetitive manner. CYP24 inhibition by genistein increased the half-life of 1,25(OH)2D3 thereby augmenting the homologous up-regulation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) both at the mRNA and protein levels. Genistein co-treatment enhanced 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation of the vitamin D responsive reporters OC-Luc and OP-Luc transfected into DU145 cells. Consistent with the growth inhibition due to the combination treatment, significant changes in the expression of genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis were seen. We conclude that genistein potentiates the antiproliferative actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 in DU145 cells by two mechanisms: (i) an increase in the half-life of 1,25(OH)2D3 due to the direct inhibition of CYP24 enzyme activity and (ii) an amplification of the homologous up-regulation of VDR. Together these two effects lead to a substantial enhancement of the cellular responses to the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic signaling by 1,25(OH)2D3.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Loss of bone mineral density is an unintended consequence of androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer. Supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D in these men seems logical and is advocated by many lay and professional groups.

  METHODS: We reviewed guidelines for calcium and vitamin D supplementation and the results of clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.

  RESULTS: Whether supplementation of men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy with calcium and/or vitamin D results in higher bone mineral density than no supplementation has not been tested. The results of 12 clinical trials show that, at the doses commonly recommended, 500-1,000 mg calcium and 200-500 IU vitamin D per day, men undergoing androgen deprivation lose bone mineral density.

  CONCLUSION: The doses of calcium and vitamin D that have been tested are inadequate to prevent loss of bone mineral density in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy. In light of evidence that high levels of dietary calcium and calcium supplement use are associated with higher risks for cardiovascular disease and advanced prostate cancer, intervention studies should evaluate the safety as well as the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in these men.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Dairy food intake has been associated with prostate cancer in previous work, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Dairy calcium may suppress circulating levels of potentially cancer-protective 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). We examined the associations of dairy, milk, calcium, and vitamin D intake with plasma 1,25(OH)2D levels among 296 men (194 black, 102 non-black) enrolled in a high risk program for prostate cancer from 10/96 to 10/07.

  METHODS: All participants completed diet and health history questionnaires and provided plasma samples, which were assessed for levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25(OH)2D. We used multivariate linear regression to examine associations with 1,25(OH)2D.

  RESULTS: After adjustment for age, race, energy intake, BMI, and alcohol intake, we observed no associations for any of our variables of interest with 1,25(OH)2D, or any meaningful differences in estimates by race or vitamin D status.

  CONCLUSION: Our findings, in a sample including a large proportion of black participants, do not confirm previous findings showing an inverse association between calcium intake and 1,25(OH)2D levels. As such, they suggest that future work should explore other mechanisms by which dairy foods and calcium might increase prostate cancer risk.
