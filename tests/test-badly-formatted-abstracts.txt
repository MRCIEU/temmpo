AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between genetic variations of Vav3 gene and 
      prostate cancer susceptibility. METHODS: Data were collected in a hospital-based 
      and case-control study of 1 015 prostate cancer cases and 1 068 cancer-free
      controls collecting from a period of time between 2008 and 2012. Based on the
      online database, NCBI dbSNP (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) and
      SNPinfo (http: //snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpfunc.htm). Functional single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) of Vav3 were screened and genotyped, and assessed their
      associations with risk of prostate cancer by using logistic regression analysis. 
      Furthermore, the associations between SNPs of Vav3 and some clinicopathological
      parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: Among the two SNPs investigated, only Vav3
      rs12410676 G>A was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk [additive
      model, OR=0.80 (0.69-0.93), P=0.003; dominant model, OR=0.81 (0.68-0.97),
      P=0.022; recessive model, OR=0.54 (0.36-0.82), P=0.004]. The combined effect of
      Vav3 rs8676 G>A and rs12410676 G>A was found as a decreased prostate cancer risk 
      along with the increased variant alleles (P<0.05). Specifically, participants
      carrying Vav3 rs12410676 AA/AG genotypes were more likely to be at lower prostate
      cancer risk, compared with participants carrying GG genotypes, in groups of
      BMI</=25 kg/m(2,) smoking, Gleason>7(4+ 3), and higher invasive prostate cancer. 
      Finally, some positive findings were evidently significant with false positive
      report probability values at different prior probability levels (0.25, 0.1 and
      0.01). CONCLUSION: Vav3 SNPs may contribute to the risk of prostate cancer in
      Eastern Chinese men, but the effect is weak and needs further validation by
      larger, multicenter and ethnic-based studies.

PG  - 446-50
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.07.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and pathological features of patients with
      prostate cancer who had only one positive biopsy core and underwent radical
      prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: A total of 62 patients with prostate cancer who had 
      only one positive biopsy core and underwent RP were enrolled. The
      clinicopathological features of the biopsy and RP were analyzed. Those factors
      that may cause discordance of Gleason score (GS) and influence pathological T
      (pT) stage on RP were further evaluated. RESULTS: Out of the 62 patients,
      40(64.5%) had pT stage >/=pT2c. The positive surgical margins, extraprostatic
      extension and seminal vesicle invasion were found in 17.7%(11/62), 9.7%(6/62) and
      3.2%(2/62) of patients, respectively. Compared to GS of RP, that of biopsy
      specimens was concordant in 39 (62.9%), higher in 6 (9.7%), and lower in 17
      (27.4%) patients. There was no significant correlation between GS discordance and
      age, preoperative PSA level, FPSA/TPSA or maximum percentage of cancer per core
      (P>0.05). The maximum percentage of cancer per core (chi(2)=6.670 7, P=0.009 8)
      and biopsy GS (chi(2)=4.020 0, P=0.045 0) were significantly related to the pT
      stage on RP. CONCLUSIONS: Single positive core prostate cancer at biopsy should
      not be considered as a low-risk disease. Although the preoperative
      clinicopathological factors cannot predict lower GS on biopsy, the maximum
      percentage of cancer per core and GS on biopsy are of significance to the pT
      stage on RP.

TI  - Metastasis: new functional implications of platelets and megakaryocytes.
PG  - 24-31
LID - 10.1182/blood-2016-01-636399 [doi]
AB  - Platelets are essential components of hemostasis. Due to a plethora of factors
      released on activation, platelet functions are also connected to tumor growth,
      notably by acting on angiogenesis. It is now well recognized that major roles of 
      platelets in the poor outcome of cancer patients occurs during hematogenous
      dissemination of cancer cells. In this review, we describe recent insights into
      the molecular mechanisms supporting the prometastatic activity of platelets.
      Platelets have been shown to promote survival of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
      in the bloodstream by conferring resistance to the shear stress and attack from
      natural killer cells. Recently, platelets were found to promote and/or maintain
      the state of epithelial to mesenchymal transition on CTCs through platelet
      secretion of transforming growth factor beta in response to CTC activation. At a 
      later stage in the metastatic process, platelets promote extravasation and
      establishment of metastatic cells in distant organs as observed in bone. This
      particular environment is also the site of hematopoiesis, megakaryocytopoiesis,
      and platelet production. Increasing the number of megakaryocytes (MKs) in the
      bone marrow results in a high bone mass phenotype and inhibits skeletal
      metastasis formation of prostate cancer cells. As a result of their specific
      location in vascular niches in the bone marrow, MK activity might contribute to
      the "seed and soil" suitability between CTCs and bone. In conclusion, recent
      findings have made a great advance in our knowledge on how platelets contribute
      to the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells and that may support the
      development of new antimetastasis therapies.

TI  - A cost effective analysis of fixed-dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin
      compared with dutasteride monotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia in
      Nigeria: a middle income perspective; using an interactive Markov model.
PG  - 405
LID - 10.1186/s12885-016-2431-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of Nigerian men presenting with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia is on the rise because of increase awareness about the ailment. With 
      the renewed effort by the national health insurance scheme to cover the informal 
      sector, it becomes imperative to determine the cost implication for managing
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and the cost effective drug combination to be 
      adopted. The objective of this study is to estimate cost effective analysis (CEA)
      of fixed -dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin compared with
      dutasteride monotherapy from the health service provider perspective design.
      METHODS: An interactive Markov's model was used to generate incremental cost per 
      QALY and incremental cost per life years gained. 2.9 million Men who were 50
      years of age were fed into the model. The outcome measures included: costs of
      drug treatment, consultation, acute urinary retention (AUR), transurethral
      resection of prostate (TURP), hospitalisation post TURP, and quality adjusted
      life years (QALYs), incremental cost per life years gained, and incremental cost 
      per QALY gained. RESULTS: Fixed-dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin
      (FDCT) produced an Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$1481.92 per
      Quality adjusted for life-years saved. CONCLUSION: Universal FDCT provision for
      Nigeria has major economic implications. This study in the context of its
      limitations has demonstrated the cost effectiveness of FDCT for the long term
      treatment of patients with moderate to severe BPH from the perspective of a
      developing country. Currently, there are few studies available to give economic
      data evidence to policy makers in Nigeria which is applicable to developing
      countries with similar economies. As such, the findings in this study will be
      relevant to policy makers in these countries.

TI  - Metabolic syndrome is associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients
      treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy: results from a multicentre
      prospective study.
PG  - 407
LID - 10.1186/s12885-016-2442-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-skin cancer in USA and
      the second leading cause of cancer death in Western Countries. Despite the high
      mortality associated with PCa, the only established risk factors are age, race
      and family history. A possible association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 
      PCa was firstly described in 2004 and several subsequent studies in biopsy
      cohorts have shown conflicting results. Aim of our multicentre prospective study 
      was to investigate the association between MetS and PCa in men undergoing radical
      prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: From January 2012 to June 2015, 349 consecutive men 
      undergoing RP for PCa at three centres in Italy were enrolled into a prospective 
      database. Body Mass Index (BMI) as well as waist circumference was measured
      before RP. Blood samples were also collected and tested for total PSA, fasting
      glucose, triglycerides and HDLs. Blood pressure was also recorded. We evaluated
      the association between MetS, defined according to Adult Treatment Panel III, PCa
      stage (advanced stage defined as pT >/= 3 or N1) and grade (high grade defined as
      Gleason Score >/= 4 + 3) using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Median age 
      and preoperative PSA levels were 66 years (IQR: 61-69) and 7 ng/ml (IQR: 5-10),
      respectively. Median BMI was 26.12 kg/m(2) (IQR 24-29) with 56 (16 %) obese (BMI 
      >/= 30 kg/m(2)) patients and 87 (25 %) patients with MetS. At pathological
      evaluation, advanced PCa and high-grade disease were present in 126 (36 %) and
      145 (41.5 %) patients, respectively. MetS was significantly associated with
      advanced PCa (45/87, 51 % vs 81/262, 31 %; p = 0.008) and high-grade disease
      (47/87, 54 % vs 98/262, 37 %; p = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, MetS was an 
      independent predictor of pathological stage >/= pT3a or N1 (OR: 2.227; CI:
      1.273-3.893; p = 0.005) and Gleason score >/= 4 + 3 (OR: 2.007, CI: 1.175-3.428; 
      p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: We firstly demonstrated in a European radical retropubic
      prostatectomy cohort study that MetS is associated with an increased risk of
      high-grade and advanced prostate cancer. Further studies with long term follow-up
      should evaluate the impact of Mets on PCa survival.

TI  - Rationale and design of Diabetes Prevention with active Vitamin D (DPVD): a
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - e011183
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011183 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests that vitamin D deficiency may cause both
      bone diseases and a range of non-skeletal diseases. However, most of these data
      come from observational studies, and clinical trial data on the effects of
      vitamin D supplementation on individuals with pre-diabetes are scarce and
      inconsistent. The aim of the Diabetes Prevention with active Vitamin D (DPVD)
      study is to assess the effect of eldecalcitol, active vitamin D analogue, on the 
      incidence of type 2 diabetes among individuals with pre-diabetes. METHODS AND
      ANALYSIS: DPVD is an ongoing, prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind 
      and placebo-controlled outcome study in individuals with impaired glucose
      tolerance. Participants, men and women aged >/=30 years, will be randomised to
      receive eldecalcitol or placebo. They will also be given a brief (5-10 min long) 
      talk about appropriate calorie intake from diet and exercise at each 12-week
      visit. The primary end point is the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes.
      Secondary endpoint is the number of participants who achieve normoglycaemia at
      48, 96 and 144 weeks. Follow-up is estimated to span 144 weeks. ETHICS AND
      DISSEMINATION: All protocols and an informed consent form comply with the Ethics 
      Guideline for Clinical Research (Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare).
      The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Kokura 
      Medical Association and University of Occupational and Environmental Health. The 
      study will be implemented in line with the CONSORT statement. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - A Perspective of Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers8070064 [doi]
LID - E64 [pii]
AB  - In cancer patients, the immune system is often altered with an excess of
      inhibitory factors, such as immunosuppressive cytokines, produced by regulatory T
      cells (Treg) or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). The manipulation of the 
      immune system has emerged as one of new promising therapies for cancer treatment,
      and also represents an attractive strategy to control prostate cancer (PCa).
      Therapeutic cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been the most
      investigated in clinical trials. Many trials are ongoing to define the effects of
      immune therapy with established treatments: androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
      and chemotherapy (CT) or radiotherapy (RT). This article discusses some of these 
      approaches in the context of future treatments for PCa.

TI  - Genetic, Environmental, and Disease-Associated Correlates of Vitamin D Status in 
      Children with CKD.
PG  - 1145-53
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10210915 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is endemic in children with CKD. 
      We sought to investigate the association of genetic disposition, environmental
      factors, vitamin D supplementation, and renal function on vitamin D status in
      children with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Serum
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D, and 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D
      concentrations were measured cross-sectionally in 500 children from 12 European
      countries with CKD stages 3-5. All patients were participants of the
      Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease Study, had CKD
      stage 3-5, and were age 6-18 years old. Patients were genotyped for
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding 25-hydroxylase, vitamin D
      binding protein, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, and 24-hydroxylase. Associations
      of genetic status, season, local solar radiation, oral vitamin D supplementation,
      and disease-associated factors with vitamin D status were assessed. RESULTS: Two 
      thirds of patients were vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxy-vitamin D <16 ng/ml).
      25-Hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations varied with season and were twofold higher in
      vitamin D-supplemented patients (21.6 [14.1] versus 10.4 [10.1] ng/ml; P<0.001). 
      Glomerulopathy, albuminuria, and girls were associated with lower
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels. 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D levels were closely
      correlated with 25-hydroxy-vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D (r=0.87 and
      r=0.55; both P<0.001). 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D concentrations were higher with 
      higher c-terminal fibroblast growth factor 23 and inversely correlated with
      intact parathyroid hormone. Whereas 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels were independent 
      of renal function, 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D levels were lower with lower eGFR.
      Vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent in Turkey than in other European regions 
      independent of supplementation status and disease-related factors.
      Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the vitamin D binding protein gene were
      independently associated with lower 25-hydroxy-vitamin D and higher
      24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: Disease-related factors and vitamin D
      supplementation are the main correlates of vitamin D status in children with CKD.
      Variants in the vitamin D binding protein showed weak associations with the
      vitamin D status.

TI  - Bone Disease after Kidney Transplantation.
PG  - 1282-96
LID - 10.2215/CJN.11371015 [doi]
AB  - Bone and mineral disorders occur frequently in kidney transplant recipients and
      are associated with a high risk of fracture, morbidity, and mortality. There is a
      broad spectrum of often overlapping bone diseases seen after transplantation,
      including osteoporosis as well as persisting high- or low-turnover bone disease. 
      The pathophysiology underlying bone disorders after transplantation results from 
      a complex interplay of factors, including preexisting renal osteodystrophy and
      bone loss related to a variety of causes, such as immunosuppression and
      alterations in the parathyroid hormone-vitamin D-fibroblast growth factor 23 axis
      as well as changes in mineral metabolism. Management is complex, because
      noninvasive tools, such as imaging and bone biomarkers, do not have sufficient
      sensitivity and specificity to detect these abnormalities in bone structure and
      function, whereas bone biopsy is not a widely available diagnostic tool. In this 
      review, we focus on recent data that highlight improvements in our understanding 
      of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of 
      mineral and bone disorders in kidney transplant recipients.

TI  - Effect of N-methyl deuteration on metabolism and pharmacokinetics of
      enzalutamide.
PG  - 2181-91
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S111352 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The replacement of hydrogen with deuterium invokes a kinetic isotope 
      effect. Thus, this method is an attractive way to slow down the metabolic rate
      and modulate pharmacokinetics. PURPOSE: Enzalutamide (ENT) acts as a competitive 
      inhibitor of the androgen receptor and has been approved for the treatment of
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer by the US Food and Drug
      Administration in 2012. To attenuate the N-demethylation pathway, hydrogen atoms 
      of the N-CH3 moiety were replaced by the relatively stable isotope deuterium,
      which showed similar pharmacological activities but exhibited favorable
      pharmacokinetic properties. METHODS: We estimated in vitro and in vivo
      pharmacokinetic parameters for ENT and its deuterated analog (d3-ENT). For in
      vitro studies, intrinsic primary isotope effects (K H/K D) were determined by the
      ratio of intrinsic clearance (CLint) obtained for ENT and d3-ENT. The CLint
      values were obtained by the substrate depletion method. For in vivo studies, ENT 
      and d3-ENT were orally given to male Sprague Dawley rats separately and
      simultaneously to assess the disposition and metabolism of them. We also
      investigated the main metabolic pathway of ENT by comparing the rate of oxidation
      and hydrolysis in vitro. RESULTS: The in vitro CLint (maximum velocity/Michaelis 
      constant [V max/K m]) of d3-ENT in rat and human liver microsomes were 49.7% and 
      72.9% lower than those of the non-deuterated compound, corresponding to the K H/K
      D value of ~2. The maximum observed plasma concentration, C max, and area under
      the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to the last measurable
      sampling time point (AUC0-t) were 35% and 102% higher than those of ENT when
      orally administered to rats (10 mg/kg). The exposure of the N-demethyl metabolite
      M2 was eightfold lower, whereas that of the amide hydrolysis metabolite M1 and
      other minor metabolites was unchanged. The observed hydrolysis rate of M2 was at 
      least ten times higher than that of ENT and d3-ENT in rat plasma. CONCLUSION: ENT
      was mainly metabolized through the "parent-->M2-->M1" pathway based on in vitro
      and in vivo elimination behavior. The observed in vitro deuterium isotope effect 
      translated into increased exposure of the deuterated analog in rats. Once the
      carbon-hydrogen was replaced with carbon-deuterium (C-D) bonds, the major
      metabolic pathway was retarded because of the relatively stable C-D bonds. The
      systemic exposure to d3-ENT can increase in humans, so the dose requirements can 
      be reduced appropriately.

TI  - Synthesis and Evaluation of Tricarbonyl (99m)Tc-Labeled
      2-(4-Chloro)phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine Analogs as Novel SPECT Imaging
      Radiotracer for TSPO-Rich Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17071085 [doi]
LID - E1085 [pii]
AB  - The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) levels are associated with brain, breast, 
      and prostate cancer progression and have emerged as viable targets for cancer
      therapy and imaging. In order to develop highly selective and active ligands with
      a high affinity for TSPO, imidazopyridine-based TSPO ligand (CB256, 3) was
      prepared as the precursor. (99m)Tc- and Re-CB256 (1 and 2, respectively) were
      synthesized in high radiochemical yield (74.5% +/- 6.4%, decay-corrected, n = 5) 
      and chemical yield (65.6%) by the incorporation of the
      [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(3)](+) and (NEt(4))(2)[Re(CO)(3)Br(3)] followed by HPLC
      separation. Radio-ligand 1 was shown to be stable (>99%) when incubated in human 
      serum for 4 h at 37 degrees C with a relatively low lipophilicity (logD = 2.15
      +/- 0.02). The rhenium-185 and -187 complex 2 exhibited a moderate affinity (Ki =
      159.3 +/- 8.7 nM) for TSPO, whereas its cytotoxicity evaluated on TSPO-rich tumor
      cell lines was lower than that observed for the precursor. In vitro uptake
      studies of 1 in C6 and U87-MG cells for 60 min was found to be 9.84% +/- 0.17%
      and 7.87% +/- 0.23% ID, respectively. Our results indicated that (99m)Tc-CB256
      can be considered as a potential new TSPO-rich cancer SPECT imaging agent and
      provides the foundation for further in vivo evaluation.

TI  - Anti-Cancer Effect of Lambertianic Acid by Inhibiting the AR in LNCaP Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17071066 [doi]
LID - E1066 [pii]
AB  - Lambertianic acid (LA) is known to have anti-allergic and antibacterial effects. 
      However, the anticancer activities and mechanism of action of LA have not been
      investigated. Therefore, the anticancer effects and mechanism of LA are
      investigated in this study. LA decreased not only AR protein levels, but also
      cellular and secretory levels of PSA. Furthermore, LA inhibited nuclear
      translocation of the AR induced by mibolerone. LA suppressed cell proliferation
      by inducing G(1) arrest, downregulating CDK4/6 and cyclin D1 and activating p53
      and its downstream molecules, p21 and p27. LA induced apoptosis and the
      expression of related proteins, including cleaved caspase-9 and -3, c-PARP and
      BAX, and inhibited BCl-2. The role of AR in LA-induced apoptosis was assessed by 
      using siRNA. Collectively, these findings suggest that LA exerts the anticancer
      effect by inhibiting AR and is a valuable therapeutic agent in prostate cancer
      treatment.

TI  - Validation of a food-frequency questionnaire for assessing vitamin intake of
      Japanese women in early and late pregnancy with and without nausea and vomiting.
PG  - e27
LID - 10.1017/jns.2016.14 [doi]
AB  - Maternal vitamin intake during pregnancy is crucial for pregnancy outcomes and
      the child's subsequent health. However, there are few valid instruments for
      assessing vitamin intake that address the effects of nausea and vomiting during
      pregnancy (NVP). This study aimed to investigate the validity of a FFQ concerning
      vitamin intake during early and late pregnancy with and without NVP. The
      participants comprised 200 Japanese pregnant women who completed the FFQ and from
      whom blood samples were taken in early and late pregnancy. Energy-adjusted
      dietary vitamin intakes (vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin A,
      vitamin E and vitamin D) from FFQ were compared with their blood concentrations. 
      A subgroup of women with NVP was investigated. In early pregnancy, significant
      correlations between FFQ and biomarkers were observed for vitamin C (r 0.27),
      folate (r 0.18) and vitamin D (r 0.26) in women with NVP and for vitamin A (r
      0.18), vitamin B12 (r 0.24) and vitamin D (r 0.23) in women without NVP. No
      significant correlations were observed in either group for vitamins B6 or E. In
      late pregnancy, similar significant associations were observed for vitamin C (r
      0.27), folate (r 0.22), vitamin B6 (r 0.18), vitamin B12 (r 0.27) and vitamin A
      (r 0.15); coefficients were higher among women without NVP. Our study
      demonstrates that the FFQ is a useful tool for assessing intake of several
      important vitamins in early and late pregnancy regardless of NVP status.

TI  - Rab11 and Lysotracker Markers Reveal Correlation between Endosomal Pathways and
      Transfection Efficiency of Surface-Functionalized Cationic Liposome-DNA
      Nanoparticles.
PG  - 6439-53
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b04441 [doi]
AB  - Cationic liposomes (CLs) are widely studied as carriers of DNA and
      short-interfering RNA for gene delivery and silencing, and related clinical
      trials are ongoing. Optimization of transfection efficiency (TE) requires
      understanding of CL-nucleic acid nanoparticle (NP) interactions with cells, NP
      endosomal pathways, endosomal escape, and events leading to release of active
      nucleic acid from the lipid carrier. Here, we studied endosomal pathways and TE
      of surface-functionalized CL-DNA NPs in PC-3 prostate cancer cells displaying
      overexpressed integrin and neuropilin-1 receptors. The NPs contained
      RGD-PEG-lipid or RPARPAR-PEG-lipid, targeting integrin, and neuropilin-1
      receptors, respectively, or control PEG-lipid. Fluorescence colocalization using 
      Rab11-GFP and Lysotracker enabled simultaneous colocalization of NPs with
      recycling endosome (Rab11) and late endosome/lysosome (Rab7/Lysotracker) pathways
      at increasing mole fractions of pentavalent MVL5 (+5 e) at low (10 mol %), high
      (50 mol %), and very high (70 mol %) membrane charge density (sigmaM). For these 
      cationic NPs (lipid/DNA molar charge ratio, rhochg = 5), the influence of
      membrane charge density on pathway selection and transfection efficiency is
      similar for both peptide-PEG NPs, although, quantitatively, the effect is larger 
      for RGD-PEG compared to RPARPAR-PEG NPs. At low sigmaM, peptide-PEG NPs show
      preference for the recycling endosome over the late endosome/lysosome pathway.
      Increases in sigmaM, from low to high, lead to decreases in colocalization with
      recycling endosomes and simultaneous increases in colocalization with the late
      endosome/lysosome pathway. Combining colocalization and functional TE data at low
      and high sigmaM shows that higher TE correlates with a larger fraction of NPs
      colocalized with the late endosome/lysosome pathway while lower TE correlates
      with a larger fraction of NPs colocalized with the Rab11 recycling pathway. The
      findings lead to a hypothesis that increases in sigmaM, leading to enhanced late 
      endosome/lysosome pathway selection and higher TE, result from increased
      nonspecific electrostatic attractions between NPs and endosome luminal membranes,
      and conversely, enhanced recycling pathway for NPs and lower TE are due to weaker
      attractions. Surprisingly, at very high sigmaM, the inverse relation between the 
      two pathways observed at low and high sigmaM breaks down, pointing to a more
      complex NP pathway behavior.

LID - 10.1039/c6lc00241b [doi]
AB  - Analysis of the intracellular materials of a small number of cancer cells at the 
      single-cell level is important to improve our understanding of cellular
      heterogeneity in rare cells. To analyze an extremely small number of cancer cells
      (less than hundreds of cells), an efficient system is required in order to
      analyze target cells with minimal sample loss. Here, we present a novel approach 
      utilizing an advanced electroactive double-well array (EdWA) for on-chip analysis
      of a small number of cancer cells at the single-cell level with minimal loss of
      target cells. The EdWA consisted of cell-sized trap-wells for deterministic
      single-cell trapping using dielectrophoresis and high aspect ratio reaction-wells
      for confining the cell lysates extracted by lysing trapped single cells via
      electroporation. We demonstrated a highly efficient single-cell arraying (a cell 
      capture efficiency of 96 +/- 3%) by trapping diluted human prostate cancer cells 
      (PC3 cells). On-chip single-cell analysis was performed by measuring the
      intracellular beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity after lysing the trapped
      single cells inside a tightly enclosed EdWA in the presence of a fluorogenic
      enzyme substrate. The PC3 cells showed large cell-to-cell variations in beta-gal 
      activity although they were cultured under the same conditions in a culture dish.
      This simple and effective system has great potential for high throughput

TI  - Anticancer Effect of Fucoidan on DU-145 Prostate Cancer Cells through Inhibition 
      of PI3K/Akt and MAPK Pathway Expression.
LID - 10.3390/md14070126 [doi]
LID - E126 [pii]
AB  - In this study, we showed that PI3K/Akt signaling mediates fucoidan's anticancer
      effects on prostate cancer cells, including suppression of proliferation.
      Fucoidan significantly decreased viability of DU-145 cancer cells in a
      concentration-dependent manner as shown by MTT
      [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. The drug
      also significantly increased chromatin condensation, which indicates apoptosis,
      in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by DAPI
      (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. Fucoidan increased expression of Bax,
      cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase and cleaved caspase-9, and decreased of the
      Bcl-2, p-Akt, p-PI3K, p-P38, and p-ERK in a concentration-dependent manner. In
      vivo, fucoidan (at 5 and 10 mg/kg) significantly decreased tumor volume, and
      increased apoptosis as assessed by the TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assay, confirming the tumor inhibitory
      effect. The drug also increased expression of p-Akt and p-ERK as shown by
      immunohistochemistry staining. Therefore, fucoidan may be a promising cancer
      preventive medicine due to its growth inhibitory effects and induction of
      apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.

TI  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen targeted protein contrast agents for molecular
      imaging of prostate cancer by MRI.
PG  - 12668-82
LID - 10.1039/c5nr09071g [doi]
AB  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is one of the most specific cell
      surface markers for prostate cancer diagnosis and targeted treatment. However,
      achieving molecular imaging using non-invasive MRI with high resolution has yet
      to be achieved due to the lack of contrast agents with significantly improved
      relaxivity for sensitivity, targeting capabilities and metal selectivity. We have
      previously reported our creation of a novel class of protein Gd(3+) contrast
      agents, ProCA32, which displayed significantly improved relaxivity while
      exhibiting strong Gd(3+) binding selectivity over physiological metal ions. In
      this study, we report our effort in further developing biomarker-targeted protein
      MRI contrast agents for molecular imaging of PSMA. Among three PSMA targeted
      contrast agents engineered with addition of different molecular recognition
      sequences, ProCA32.PSMA exhibits a binding affinity of 1.1 +/- 0.1 muM for PSMA
      while the metal binding affinity is maintained at 0.9 +/- 0.1 x 10(-22) M. In
      addition, ProCA32.PSMA exhibits r1 of 27.6 mM(-1) s(-1) and r2 of 37.9 mM(-1)
      s(-1) per Gd (55.2 and 75.8 mM(-1) s(-1) per molecule r1 and r2, respectively) at
      1.4 T. At 7 T, ProCA32.PSMA also has r2 of 94.0 mM(-1) s(-1) per Gd (188.0 mM(-1)
      s(-1) per molecule) and r1 of 18.6 mM(-1) s(-1) per Gd (37.2 mM(-1) s(-1) per
      molecule). This contrast capability enables the first MRI enhancement dependent
      on PSMA expression levels in tumor bearing mice using both T1 and T2-weighted MRI
      at 7 T. Further development of these PSMA-targeted contrast agents are expected
      to be used for the precision imaging of prostate cancer at an early stage and to 
      monitor disease progression and staging, as well as determine the effect of
      therapeutic treatment by non-invasive evaluation of the PSMA level using MRI.

TI  - Polymorphism in IGFBP3 gene is associated with prostate cancer risk: an updated
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 4163-71
LID - 10.2147/OTT.S102452 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) is the major
      protein that binds with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and is considered to
      be involved in the development and progression of various cancers. We aimed to
      examine the association between prostate cancer (PCa) and the IGFBP3 gene-202A/C 
      polymorphism. METHODS: A comprehensive search within PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane
      Library was conducted to identify all case-control studies up to October 30,
      2015, for a meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) were calculated using the fixed or random effects model. RESULTS:
      Eighteen studies including 10,538 cases and 10,078 controls were identified.
      Overall, the CC genotype of IGFBP3-202A/C polymorphism was associated with
      increased risk of PCa in homozygote comparison (CC vs AA - OR =1.16, 95% CI:
      1.08-1.25) and in recessive model (CC vs AA+AC - OR =1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.17). In
      dominant model, the CC/AC genotypes also implicated an increased risk of PCa
      (CC+AC vs AA - OR =1.11, 95% CI: 1.05-1.19). The C allele of IGFBP3-202A/C
      polymorphism was the risk allele for PCa relative to the A allele (OR =1.09, 95% 
      CI: 1.05-1.14). Further stratification analysis revealed that the association
      between -202A/C polymorphism and PCa risk among Caucasians, but not in other
      ethnicities, was statistically significant (recessive model, OR =1.10, 95% CI:
      1.02-1.19). In addition, the IGFBP3-202A/C polymorphism was associated with PCa
      risk in both population-based and hospital-based studies in homozygote
      comparison, recessive model, and allele model. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis
      indicates that the IGFBP3-202A/C polymorphism is associated with the risk of PCa,
      particularly in Caucasians, with the C allele being the risk allele for PCa.

      breathing: differentiation between prostate cancer and benign prostate
      hyperplasia and correlation with vessel maturity.
PG  - 4143-50
LID - 10.2147/OTT.S105480 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the blood oxygenation
      level-dependent (BOLD) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can evaluate
      tumor maturity and preoperatively differentiate prostate cancer (PCa) from benign
      prostate hyperplasia (BPH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: BOLD MRI based on transverse
      relaxation time*-weighted echo planar imaging was performed to assess PCa (19)
      and BPH (22) responses to carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2). The average signal values
      of PCa and BPH before and after carbogen breathing and the relative increased
      signal values were computed, respectively. The endothelial-cell marker, CD31, and
      the pericyte marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin (mature vessels), were detected
      with immunofluorescence, and were assessed by microvessel density (MVD) and
      microvessel pericyte density (MPD). The microvessel pericyte coverage index (MPI)
      was used to evaluate the degree of vascular maturity. The changed signal from
      BOLD MRI was correlated with MVD, MPD, and MPI. RESULTS: After inhaling carbogen,
      both PCa and BPH showed an increased signal, but a lower slope was found in PCa
      than that in BPH (P<0.05). PCa had a higher MPD and MVD but a lower MPI than BPH.
      The increased signal intensity was positively correlated with MPI in PCa and that
      in BPH (r=0.616, P=0.011; r=0.658, P=0.002); however, there was no correlation
      between the increased signal intensity and MPD or MVD in PCa than that in BPH
      (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that the increased signal values
      induced by BOLD MRI well differentiated PCa from BPH and had a positive
      correlation with vessel maturity in both of them. BOLD MRI can be utilized as a
      surrogate marker for the noninvasive assessment of the degree of vessel maturity.

      hypermethylation and microRNA-associated regulation.
PG  - 3598-606
LID - 10.1038/onc.2015.445 [doi]
AB  - The transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding
      RNAs, which are absolutely conserved (100%) between the orthologous regions of
      the human, rat and mouse genomes. Previous studies have described that several
      T-UCRs show differential expressions in cancers and might be involved in cancer
      development. We investigated the transcriptional levels of representative 26
      T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differently expressed in prostate
      cancer (PCa) and gastric cancer (GC). A quantitative reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of
      Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored
      by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing
      using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG
      hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in 
      GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of
      Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of
      miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were
      significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct
      regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was
      associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth
      factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of
      Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into 
      functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology.

      wild-type mice rarely induced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in dorsal
      prostates (one out of eight mice), the loss of ATF3 led to the appearance of not 
      only PIN but also invasive lesions in almost all examined animals. The enhanced
      carcinogenic effects of hormones on ATF3-deficient prostates did not appear to be
      caused by a change in estrogen signaling, but were more likely a consequence of
      elevated androgen signaling that stimulated differentiation of prostatic basal
      cells into transformation-preferable luminal cells. Indeed, we found that
      hormone-induced lesions in ATF3-knockout mice often contained cells with both
      basal and luminal characteristics, such as p63(+) cells (a basal-cell marker)
      showing luminal-like morphology, or cells double-stained with basal (CK5(+)) and 
      luminal (CK8(+)) markers. Consistent with these findings, low ATF3 expression was
      found to be a poor prognostic marker for prostate cancer in a cohort of 245
      patients. Our results thus support that ATF3 is a tumor suppressor in prostate
      cancer.
