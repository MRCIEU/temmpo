TI  - Nocturnal light pollution and underexposure to daytime sunlight: Complementary
      mechanisms of circadian disruption and related diseases.
PG  - 1-20
AB  - Routine exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) in work, home, and community
      settings is linked with increased risk of breast and prostate cancer (BC, PC) in 
      normally sighted women and men, the hypothesized biological rhythm mechanisms
      being frequent nocturnal melatonin synthesis suppression, circadian time
      structure (CTS) desynchronization, and sleep/wake cycle disruption with sleep
      deprivation. ALAN-induced perturbation of the CTS melatonin synchronizer signal
      is communicated maternally at the very onset of life and after birth via breast
      or artificial formula feedings. Nighttime use of personal computers, mobile
      phones, electronic tablets, televisions, and the like - now epidemic in
      adolescents and adults and highly prevalent in pre-school and school-aged
      children - is a new source of ALAN. However, ALAN exposure occurs concomitantly
      with almost complete absence of daytime sunlight, whose blue-violet (446-484 nm
      lambda) spectrum synchronizes the CTS and whose UV-B (290-315 nm lambda) spectrum
      stimulates vitamin D synthesis. Under natural conditions and clear skies,
      day/night and annual cycles of UV-B irradiation drive corresponding periodicities
      in vitamin D synthesis and numerous bioprocesses regulated by active metabolites 
      augment and strengthen the biological time structure. Vitamin D insufficiency and
      deficiency are widespread in children and adults in developed and developing
      countries as a consequence of inadequate sunlight exposure. Past epidemiologic
      studies have focused either on exposure to too little daytime UV-B or too much
      ALAN, respectively, on vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency or melatonin
      suppression in relation to risk of cancer and other, e.g., psychiatric,
      hypertensive, cardiac, and vascular, so-called, diseases of civilization. The
      observed elevated incidence of medical conditions the two are alleged to
      influence through many complementary bioprocesses of cells, tissues, and organs
      led us to examine effects of the totality of the artificial light environment in 
      which humans reside today. Never have chronobiologic or epidemiologic
      investigations comprehensively researched the potentially deleterious
      consequences of the combination of suppressed vitamin D plus melatonin synthesis 
      due to life in today's man-made artificial light environment, which in our
      opinion is long overdue.

TI  - Meta-analysis of vitamin D-binding protein and cancer risk.
LID - cebp.0262.2015 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence supported a role for vitamin D and vitamin D
      receptor (VDR) polymorphisms in cancer risk. Beyond VDR, the biological effects
      of vitamin D are mediated by the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), a key protein
      in vitamin D metabolism. Furthermore, the gene encoding the DBP (GC,
      Group-specific component) has an important role in vitamin D pathway. Several
      studies investigated DBP serological levels and GC polymorphisms in association
      with cancer risk with controversial results. Thus we carried out a meta-analysis 
      to investigate these associations. METHODS: We included 28 independent studies
      concerning: basal cell carcinoma, bladder, breast, colon-rectum, endometrium,
      liver, esophagus, stomach, melanoma, pancreas, prostate and kidney. Through
      random effect models we calculated the Summary Odd Ratios (SORs) for serum DBP
      and the GC polymorphisms rs2282679, rs12512631, rs7041, rs4588, rs17467825,
      rs1155563 and rs1352844. RESULTS: We found a borderline decrease in cancer risk
      for subjects with high compared to low levels of DBP (SOR;95%CI:0.75;0.56-1.00). 
      Dose-response meta-analysis indicate a non-significant decrease risk for an
      increase of 1,000 nmol/L of DBP: (SOR;95%CI:0.96;0.91-1.01). We found no
      significant alterations in cancer risk for subjects carrying any of the studied
      GC polymorphisms compared to wild-type subjects both in the main analysis and in 
      analyses stratified by cancer type and ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: We found trends
      toward significance suggesting a role of DBP in cancer etiology, that should be
      confirmed in further studies. IMPACT: To our knowledge, this is the first study
      to investigate GC polymorphisms and DBP serological levels in association with
      any type of cancer.

AB  - Nutritional systems biology is an evolving research field aimed at understanding 
      nutritional processes at a systems level. It is known that the development of
      cancer can be influenced by the nutritional status, and the link between vitamin 
      D status and different cancer types is widely investigated. In this study, we
      performed an integrative network-based analysis using a publicly available data
      set studying the role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in prostate
      cancer cells on mRNA and microRNA level. Pathway analysis revealed 15
      significantly altered pathways: eight more general mostly cell cycle-related
      pathways and seven cancer-specific pathways. The changes in the G1-to-S cell
      cycle pathway showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates the genes influencing the
      G1-to-S phase transition. Moreover, after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment the gene
      expression in several cancer-related processes was down-regulated. The more
      general pathways were merged into one network and then extended with known
      protein-protein and transcription factor-gene interactions. Network algorithms
      were used to (1) identify active network modules and (2) integrate microRNA
      regulation in the network. Adding microRNA regulation to the network enabled the 
      identification of gene targets of significantly expressed microRNAs after
      1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Six of the nine differentially expressed microRNAs target 
      genes in the extended network, including CLSPN, an important checkpoint regulator
      in the cell cycle that was down-regulated, and FZD5, a receptor for Wnt proteins 
      that was up-regulated. The extendable network-based tools PathVisio and Cytoscape
      enable straightforward, in-depth and integrative analysis of mRNA and microRNA
      expression data in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cancer cells.

AB  - Vitamin D insufficiency correlates with increased incidence of inflammatory
      disorders and cancer of the colon, breast, liver, and prostate. Preclinical
      studies demonstrated that the hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3,
      has antiproliferative, proapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory
      effects. Tissue levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 are determined by expression and activity
      of specific vitamin D hydroxylases expressed at renal and extrarenal sites. In
      order to understand how perturbations in the vitamin D system affect human
      health, we need to understand the steps involved in the synthesis and catabolism 
      of the active metabolite. This review provides an overview about recent findings 
      on the altered vitamin D metabolism in inflammatory conditions and
      carcinogenesis. We will summarize existing data on the pathophysiological
      regulation of vitamin D hydroxylases and outline the role of adequate levels of
      1,25(OH)2D3 on tissue homeostasis.

AB  - Vitamin D has taken a center-stage role in our basic and population research
      quest for the panacea for all human maladies, including cancer, yet sufficient
      evidence for a beneficial role has existed only for bone health. This Commentary 
      discusses and places into a broader context the report of Chandler and colleagues
      that found a protective association for higher vitamin D status in colorectal
      cancer in women, consistent with most other cohort studies but not with limited
      supplementation trial data. Little human evidence exists for the preventive
      potential in other malignancies, including breast cancer, with the exception of
      possible benefit in bladder cancer and an adverse serologic association with
      prostate cancer (pancreatic cancer risk may be similarly influenced) that is
      supported by vitamin D genetic data. Current vitamin D trials are examining
      high-dose supplementation (i.e., 1,600-3,333 IU daily) for effects on multiple
      outcomes, but they may not have sufficient power to test efficacy in colorectal
      or other specific malignancies and are unlikely to inform any benefit for higher 
      physiologic levels. A more complete understanding of vitamin D and human
      carcinogenesis will come from multifaceted lines of research, including
      elucidation of organ site-specific biologic mechanisms, prospective serologic
      analyses, testing of vitamin D-related genetic variation, and short-term
      clinical-metabolic biomarker studies of multidose vitamin D supplementation,
      including metabolomic profiling of controlled supplementation in these and past
      or ongoing trials. Cancer Prev Res; 8(8); 657-61. (c)2015 AACR.See related

TI  - Vitamin D and prostate cancer prognosis: a Mendelian randomization study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Decreased vitamin D levels have been associated with prostate cancer,
      but it is unclear whether this association is causal. A functional
      single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the group-specific component (GC) gene (T
      > G, rs2282679) has been associated with 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D and 1.25
      dihydroxy (1.25-OH2) vitamin D levels. METHODS: To examine the hypothesized
      inverse relationship between vitamin D status and prostate cancer, we studied the
      association between this SNP and prostate cancer outcome in the prospective
      PROCAGENE study comprising 702 prostate cancer patients with a median follow-up
      of 82 months. RESULTS: GC rs2282679 genotypes were not associated with
      biochemical recurrence [hazard ratios (HR) 0.91, 95 % confidence interval (CI)
      0.73-1.12; p = 0.36], development of metastases (HR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.88-1.63; p = 
      0.25) or overall survival (HR 1.10; 95 % CI 0.84-1.43; p = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      causal role of vitamin D status, as reflected by GC rs2282679 genotype, in
      disease progression and mortality in prostate cancer patients is unlikely.

AB  - Denosumab is an emerging new treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women
      and men with non-metastatic prostate cancer. It is largely used by specialists as
      an alternative treatment in patients with contraindications to traditional, more 
      commonly used drugs such as bisphosphonates. One important side effect is
      hypocalcaemia, which may be life threatening. The risk of this is increased in
      renal impairment, mainly if eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m(2), and is exacerbated by
      vitamin D insufficiency. This is a case study of prolonged symptomatic
      hypocalcaemia after a single dose of denosumab in a patient with non-metastatic
      prostate cancer and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 40 ml/min/1.73m(2)). The
      patient presented with acute confusion, muscle cramps and myoclonic jerks 5 weeks
      after treatment. This case demonstrates the need to be aware of adverse effects
      of denosumab in mild-moderate renal impairment and the need to monitor calcium
      levels pre- and post-treatment.

AB  - The vitamin D endocrine system regulates a broad variety of independent
      biological processes, and its deficiency is associated with rickets, bone
      diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and tuberculosis. Cellular and
      molecular studies have also shown that it is implicated in the suppression of
      cancer cell invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Sunlight exposure and
      consequent increased circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced 
      occurrence and a reduced mortality in different histological types of cancer,
      including those resident in the skin, prostate, breast, colon, ovary, kidney, and
      bladder. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a steroid hormone superfamily of nuclear
      receptors is highly expressed in epithelial cells at risk for carcinogenesis,
      providing a direct molecular link by which vitamin D status impacts on
      carcinogenesis. Because VDR expression is retained in many human tumors, vitamin 
      D status may be an important modulator of cancer progression in persons living
      with cancer. The aim of this review is to highlight the relationship between
      vitamin D, VDR, and cancer, summarizing several mechanisms proposed to explain
      the potential protective effect of vitamin D against the development and
      progression of cancer.

TI  - Molecular Mechanism(s) Involved in 25-Hydroxyvitamin D's Antiproliferative
      Effects in CYP27B1-transfected LNCaP Cells.
PG  - 3773-9
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: 1alpha,25(OH)2D has been shown to induce cell-cycle regulation,
      apoptosis and differentiation in prostate cancer cells. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that prostate and some prostate cancer cells have the ability to
      convert 25(OH)D3 to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. The aim of the present study was to
      elucidate the role of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 production by 25-hydroxyvitamin
      D-1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) on prostate cancer cell growth. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: LNCaP cells were stably transfected with CYP27B. RESULTS:
      Stably-transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP cells converted 25(OH)D3 to
      1alpha,25(OH)2D3 unlike untransfected LNCaP cells. There was a dose-dependent
      decrease in (3)H-thymidine incorporation in 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated LNCaP cells,
      not seen with 25(OH)D3 treatment, and in stably transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP
      cells treated with 25(OH)D3. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated LNCaP cells and
      25(OH)D3-treated stably-transfected 1alpha-OHase LNCaP cells demonstrated an
      increased G1 phase accumulation and apoptosis, while 25(OH)D3 treatment had no
      effect in LNCaP cells. CONCLUSION: The present study supports the hypothesis that
      local production of 1alpha,25(OH)2D is important in inhibiting prostate cancer
      development and growth.

TI  - Hypocalcaemia in patients with metastatic bone disease treated with denosumab.
PG  - 1812-21
LID - 10.1016/j.ejca.2015.05.016 [doi]
LID - S0959-8049(15)00447-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis was performed to further characterise
      treatment-emergent hypocalcaemia in patients with bone metastases receiving
      denosumab. METHODS: Laboratory abnormalities and adverse events of hypocalcaemia 
      in patients with metastatic bone disease were analysed using data from three
      identically designed phase 3 trials of subcutaneous denosumab 120mg (n=2841)
      versus intravenous zoledronic acid 4mg (n=2836). RESULTS: The overall incidence
      of laboratory events of hypocalcaemia grade 2 was higher with denosumab (12.4%)
      than with zoledronic acid (5.3%). Hypocalcaemia events were primarily grade 2 in 
      severity and usually occurred within the first 6months of treatment. Patients who
      reported taking calcium and/or vitamin D supplements had a lower incidence of
      hypocalcaemia. Prostate cancer or small-cell lung cancer, reduced creatinine
      clearance and higher baseline bone turnover markers of urinary N-telopeptide of
      type I collagen (uNTx; >50 versus 50nmol/mmol) and bone-specific alkaline
      phosphatase (BSAP; >20.77mug/L [median] versus 20.77mug/L) values were important 
      risk factors for developing hypocalcaemia. The risk associated with increased
      baseline BSAP levels was greater among patients who had >2 bone metastases at
      baseline versus those with 2 bone metastases at baseline. CONCLUSION:
      Hypocalcaemia was more frequent with denosumab versus zoledronic acid, consistent
      with denosumab's greater antiresorptive effect. Low serum calcium levels and
      potential vitamin D deficiency should be corrected before initiating treatment
      with a potent osteoclast inhibitor, and corrected serum calcium levels should be 
      monitored during treatment. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake appears to
      substantially reduce the risk of hypocalcaemia.

TI  - Risk of prostate cancer in African-American men: Evidence of mixed effects of
      dietary quercetin by serum vitamin D status.
PG  - 1376-83
LID - 10.1002/pros.23018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: African-American (AA) men experience higher rates of prostate cancer 
      (PCa) and vitamin D (vitD) deficiency than white men. VitD is promoted for PCa
      prevention, but there is conflicting data on the association between vitD and
      PCa. We examined the association between serum vitD and dietary quercetin and
      their interaction with PCa risk in AA men. METHODS: Participants included 90 AA
      men with PCa undergoing treatment at Howard University Hospital (HUH) and 62
      controls participating in HUH's free PCa screening program. We measured serum
      25-hydroxy vitD [25(OH)D] and used the 98.2 item Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency 
      Questionnaires to measure dietary intake of quercetin and other nutrients. Case
      and control groups were compared using a two-sample t-test for continuous risk
      factors and a Fisher exact test for categorical factors. Associations between
      risk factors and PCa risk were examined via age-adjusted logistic regression
      models. RESULTS: Interaction effects of dietary quercetin and serum vitD on PCa
      status were observed. AA men (age 40-70) with normal levels of serum vitD (>30
      ng/ml) had a 71% lower risk of PCa compared to AA men with vitD deficiency (OR = 
      0.29, 95%CI: 0.08-1.03; P = 0.055). In individuals with vitD deficiency,
      increased dietary quercetin showed a tendency toward lower risk of PCa (OR =
      0.91, 95%CI: 0.82-1.00; P = 0.054, age-adjusted) while men with normal vitD were 
      at elevated risk (OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.04-1.45). CONCLUSION: These findings
      suggest that AA men who are at a higher risk of PCa may benefit more from vitD
      intake, and supplementation with dietary quercetin may increase the risk of PCa
      in AA men with normal vitD levels. Further studies with larger populations are
      needed to better understand the impact of the interaction between sera vitD
      levels and supplementation with quercetin on PCa in AA men. Prostate

TI  - Association of the CYP24A1-rs2296241 polymorphism of the vitamin D catabolism
      enzyme with hormone-related cancer risk: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1175-83
LID - 10.2147/OTT.S80311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evidence for vitamin D reducing cancer risk is inconsistent, and 
      it is not clear whether this reduction is related to variation in cytochrome P450
      (CYP)24A1, the only enzyme known to degrade active vitamin D. We focused on
      evaluating the association of CYP24A1-rs2296241 polymorphism with hormone-related
      cancer risk by conducting a meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature
      search was conducted in April 2014 (updated in December 2014) to identify
      eligible studies. A random-effects model was used to pool the odds ratio (OR).
      RESULTS: Eleven studies including 5,145 cases and 5,136 controls were considered 
      for the allelic model, and eight studies of 3,959 cases and 3,560 controls were
      utilized for the additive, recessive, and dominant models. There was no
      significant association between CYP24A1-rs2296241 and hormone-related cancer risk
      in any of the models, yet substantial heterogeneity was observed. Subgroup
      analyses indicated that CYP24A1-rs2296241 variation reduced the prostate cancer
      risk in the additive (OR 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.85-0.97) and recessive
      (OR 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.95) models, with no evidence of
      heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that CYP24A1-rs2296241
      polymorphism reduced the androgen-related prostate cancer risk in additive and
      recessive models. More genetic loci are needed to confirm the effect of CYP24A1
      variation on the risk of prostate cancer.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and cancer in Saudi Arabian populations: 
      Can we hypothesize a link?

AB  - Inspite of having so much sunshine, Saudi Arabian population is suffering from
      the deficiency of the 'sunshine vitamin', vitamin D, measured in the serum as
      25-OHD level. According to a recent report, about 83.6% of Saudi population is
      vitamin D deficient. 31.9% have severe, 32% have moderate and 19.7% have mild
      vitamin D deficiency (VDD). The severity of VDD differs with age, gender and
      region. Females are more severely vitamin D deficient than males. Various factors
      contributing towards it deficiency are linked to their housing designs, religious
      practices, lifestyle choices and dark skin color. The increasing incidences of
      breast, prostate and colon cancer among this society are also raising an alarm.
      The presence of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the enzyme responsible for
      conversion of the 25(OH)D in its active metabolite 25(OH)2D3 in extra renal
      tissue shows the involvement of vitamin D in other diseases like cancer,
      diabetes, multiple sclerosis etc. About 2000 genes related to various types of
      diseases are found to be regulated by VDRs. These genes possess vitamin D
      responsive elements (VDREs) in their promoters. Studies on population of other
      regions also have shown correlation with low serum levels of 25(OH)D and certain 
      diseases So, we hypothesized that vitamin D deficiencies might cause a higher
      prevalence of these diseases in the Kingdom.

TI  - FGF23 promotes prostate cancer progression.
PG  - 17291-301
AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in US men and the second leading cause 
      of cancer deaths. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an endocrine FGF,
      normally expressed by osteocytes, which plays a critical role in phosphate
      homeostasis via a feedback loop involving the kidney and vitamin D. We now show
      that FGF23 is expressed as an autocrine growth factor in all prostate cancer cell
      lines tested and is present at increased levels in prostate cancer tissues.
      Exogenous FGF23 enhances proliferation, invasion and anchorage independent growth
      in vitro while FGF23 knockdown in prostate cancer cell lines decreases these
      phenotypes. FGF23 knockdown also decreases tumor growth in vivo. Given that
      classical FGFs and FGF19 are also increased in prostate cancer, we analyzed
      expression microarrays hybridized with RNAs from of LNCaP cells stimulated with
      FGF2, FGF19 or FGF23. The different FGF ligands induce overlapping as well as
      unique patterns of gene expression changes and thus are not redundant. We
      identified multiple genes whose expression is altered by FGF23 that are
      associated with prostate cancer initiation and progression. Thus FGF23 can
      potentially also act as an autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine growth factor in
      prostate cancer that can promote prostate cancer progression.

AB  - Bone is a hormonally responsive organ. Sex hormones and calcium regulating
      hormones, including parathyroid hormone, 1-25 dihydroxy vitamin D, and
      calcitonin, have effects on bone resorption and bone deposition. These hormones
      affect both bone quality and bone quantity. The sex hormone estrogen inhibits
      bone resorption, and estrogen therapy has been developed to prevent and treat
      osteoporosis. Androgens are an important source of estrogen through the action of
      the enzyme aromatase and may themselves stimulate bone formation. Hence, the sex 
      steroids play a role in bone metabolism. Breast cancer and prostate cancer are
      frequently hormonally responsive and may be treated with antiestrogens or
      antiandrogens respectfully. In addition, chemotherapy and supportive medications 
      may alter the patient's endocrine system. In general, the suppression of sex
      hormones has a predictable affect on bone health, as seen by loss of bone mineral
      density and increased risk of fragility fractures. The bone toxicity of
      cancer-directed endocrine therapy can be mitigated through screening, counseling 
      on optimization of calcium and vitamin D intake, exercise, and other
      lifestyle/behavioral actions, as well as the use of medications when the fracture
      risk is high. Maintaining bone health in patients who are treated with endocrine 
      therapy for breast and prostate cancer is the focus of this review.

TI  - Pre-diagnostic vitamin D concentrations and cancer risks in older individuals: an
      analysis of cohorts participating in the CHANCES consortium.
AB  - The associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations with
      total and site-specific cancer incidence have been examined in several
      epidemiological studies with overall inconclusive findings. Very little is known 
      about the association of vitamin D with cancer incidence in older populations. We
      assessed the association of pre-diagnostic serum 25(OH)D levels with incidence of
      all cancers combined and incidence of lung, colorectal, breast, prostate and
      lymphoid malignancies among older adults. Pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D concentrations
      and cancer incidence were available in total for 15,486 older adults (mean age
      63, range 50-84 years) participating in two cohort studies: ESTHER (Germany) and 
      TROMSO (Norway); and a subset of previously published nested-case control data
      from a another cohort study: EPIC-Elderly (Greece, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain
      and Sweden) from the CHANCES consortium on health and aging. Cox proportional
      hazards or logistic regression were used to derive multivariable adjusted hazard 
      and odds ratios, respectively, and their 95 % confidence intervals across 25(OH)D
      categories. Meta-analyses with random effects models were used to pool
      study-specific risk estimates. Overall, lower 25(OH)D concentrations were not
      significantly associated with increased incidence of most of the cancers
      assessed. However, there was some evidence of increased breast cancer and
      decreased lymphoma risk with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. Our meta-analyses
      with individual participant data from three large European population-based
      cohort studies provide at best limited support for the hypothesis that vitamin D 
      may have a major role in cancer development and prevention among European older
      adults.

TI  - Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in Bulgarian patients with prostate cancer: a
      pilot study.
PG  - 329-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antiproliferative effect of the active form of vitamin D on
      cancer cells and its ability to induce cell differentiation and suppression of
      tumor-induced angiogenesis in the last decade has provoked enormous research for 
      the elucidation of its role in the prevention of different types of cancer and in
      slowing down the malignancy progression. The aim of the present pilot study was
      to determine the circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels in Bulgarian
      prostate cancer (PCa) patients and to investigate their relationship with various
      determinants associated with the severity and progression of the disease.
      METHODS: A total of 53 male patients (mean age 67.0 +/- 7.1 years) with clinical 
      suspicion for PCa were enrolled in the study. All patients were subjected to
      systemic transrectal ultrasound-guided tru-cut prostate biopsies (10 cores at
      least). Detected tumors were graded using the Gleason grading system. Prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) serum levels were measured immunochemically. The 25OHD
      assay was performed by a validated HPLC-UV method. Other covariates (BMI, age,
      family history of PCa) were collected by interview at the time of
      hospitalization. One-way ANOVA with Kruskal Wallis statistics was used for
      comparison of medians of different parameters. The level of significance was set 
      at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Significantly lower 25OHD levels were detected in PCa
      patients compared to those with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (p < 0.05).
      Patients with high grade tumors (Gleason score >/= 7) showed significantly lower 
      25OHD levels, while those with low grade tumors (Gleason score < 7) revealed
      better 25OHD status (50.49 vs. 63.17 nmol/L, p < 0.05). A moderate negative
      correlation between 25OHD levels and the Gleason score was established (Spearman 
      r = -0.46, p < 0.05). Significant seasonal variations in 25OHD levels, both for
      PCa and BPH patients, were detected (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary
      study shows an association between 25OHD status and classical markers
      characterizing the severity of PCa. The results might suggest a potential
      beneficial role of vitamin D for PCa patients. Further prospective studies are
      needed to strengthen the interrelationships between 25OHD levels and variables
      related with PCa and to test them for causality.

TI  - 19-Norvitamin D analogs for breast cancer therapy.
PG  - 333-48
LID - 10.1139/cjpp-2014-0452 [doi]
AB  - The active form of vitamin D3, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or
      calcitriol), is known to inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness of many types
      of cancer cells, including breast, colon, pancreatic, prostate, and liver cancer 
      cells. These findings support the use of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 for the treatment of
      these types of cancer. However, 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 can cause hypercalcemia, so
      analogs of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 that are less calcemic but exhibit more potent
      anti-tumor activity would be good candidates as therapeutic agents. Therefore, a 
      series of 19-norvitamin D analogs, in which the methylidene group on C19 is
      replaced with 2 hydrogen atoms, have been synthesized by several laboratories. In
      our laboratory, we have designed and synthesized a series of 2alpha-functional
      group substituted 19-norvitamin D3 analogs and examined their anti-proliferative 
      activity. Among them, 2alpha- and
      2beta-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1alpha,25-dihydroxy-19-norvitamin D3 (MART-10 and
      MART-11) were found to be the most promising. Here, we review the rationale and
      approaches for the synthesis of different 19-norvitamin D analogs, and the
      pre-clinical studies using these analogs in breast cancer cells, in particular,
      we chose MART-10 for its potential application to the prevention and treatment of
      breast cancer.

TI  - Cardiometabolic and skeletal risk factors in black men with prostate cancer
      starting androgen deprivation therapy.
PG  - 679-87
LID - 10.3390/cancers7020679 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is
      associated with multiple metabolic complications, previously predominantly
      evaluated in the white population. METHODS: A chart-based retrospective review
      was conducted on black patients with PCa, considered for ADT, from September 2007
      to July 2010. Baseline data were collected on body mass index (BMI), vitamin-D
      status, bone mineral density (BMD), dyslipidemia and diabetes. Overweight and
      obesity were classified as BMI >/= 25 and BMI >/= 30, respectively. Vitamin-D
      sufficiency was defined as levels >/=30 ng/mL, insufficiency as <30 ng/mL and
      deficiency as </=20 ng/mL. Osteopenia was defined as T scores between -1 to -2.5 
      and osteoporosis when T scores </=-2.5. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort of 130
      black men, 111 (85.4%) patients underwent ADT. At baseline, average BMI was 28.1 
      +/- 5.9 with 43.3% of men being overweight and 30.8% obese. More than one-third
      of the patients had pre-existing dyslipidemia while 28.8% were diabetics. 50%
      were vitamin-D deficient while 41% had low bone mass. CONCLUSIONS: Black men with
      PCa presenting for consideration of ADT have a high prevalence of existing
      metabolic risk factors. Close monitoring of this patient population is needed
      during ADT to prevent and treat metabolic complications.

TI  - Vitamin D-binding protein and pancreatic cancer: a nested case-control study.
PG  - 1206-15
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.114.096016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is the primary carrier of
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in the circulation. One prospective study in male
      smokers found a protective association between DBP and pancreatic cancer,
      particularly among men with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. OBJECTIVE: The
      objective was to examine the association between DBP and pancreatic cancer risk
      in an American population. DESIGN: We conducted a nested case-control study in
      the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer screening trial cohort of men 
      and women aged 55-74 y at baseline. Between 1993 and 2010, 295 incident
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases were reported (follow-up to 15.1 y). Two controls
      (n = 590) were matched to each case by age, race, sex, and month of blood draw.
      We calculated smoking- and diabetes-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs with the use of
      conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: DBP concentration was not significantly
      associated with pancreatic cancer overall [highest (>/=7149.4 nmol/L) vs. lowest 
      (<3670.4 nmol/L) quintile; OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.91, 3.37; P-trend = 0.25]. For
      serum 25(OH)D compared with the referent (50 to <75 nmol/L), individuals in the
      highest group had a significantly higher risk (>/=100 nmol/L; OR: 3.23; 95% CI:
      1.24, 8.44), whereas those in the lowest group had no significant association
      (<25 nmol/L; OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 0.92, 6.81). Further adjustment for DBP did not
      alter this association. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the hypothesis
      that serum DBP or 25(OH)D plays a protective role in pancreatic cancer. This
      trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00339495.

TI  - Vitamin D3 potentiates the growth inhibitory effects of metformin in DU145 human 
      prostate cancer cells mediated by AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway.
PG  - 711-7

AB  - Metformin and vitamin D(3) both exhibit a strong antiproliferative action in
      numerous cancer cell lines, including in human prostate cancer cells. Here we
      showed that the combination of the two drugs had a much stronger effect on DU145 
      human prostate cancer cell growth than either drug alone. In this research, cell 
      proliferation was measured by methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell
      apoptosis was determined with Hoechst 33342 staining. Western blotting and cell
      cycle analyses were used to elucidate potential mechanisms of interaction between
      the drugs. It is shown that in cultured DU145 cells, vitamin D(3) combined with
      metformin exhibits synergistic effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis. The
      underlying antitumor mechanisms may involve altered cycle distribution with a
      G1/S cell cycle arrest, activation of phospho-AMPK with subsequent inhibition of 
      downstream mTOR signalling pathway, down-regulate c-Myc expression, and reducing 
      the level of anti-apoptotic protein p-Bcl-2. In conclusion, metformin and vitamin
      D(3) synergistically inhibit DU145 cell growth, indicating a promising clinical
      therapeutic strategy for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Radiation-induced injury to normal tissues is a common complication of
      radiation therapy in cancer patients. Considering the role of vitamin D in
      mucosal barrier hemostasis and inflammatory responses, we investigated whether
      vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of radiation-induced acute
      proctitis in cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective
      observational study was conducted in cancer patients referred for pelvic
      radiation therapy. Serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured before
      radiation therapy. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      concentrations of <35 nmol/L and <40 nmol/L in male and female patients,
      respectively, based on available normative data. Acute proctitis was assessed
      after 5 weeks of radiation therapy (total received radiation dose of 50 Gy) and
      graded from 0 to 4 using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria.
      RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (57.1% male) with a mean age of 62.8 +/- 9.1 years
      were studied. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 57 patients (58.1%). Symptoms of 
      acute proctitis occurred in 72 patients (73.4%) after radiation therapy. RTOG
      grade was significantly higher in patients with vitamin D deficiency than in
      normal cases (median [interquartile range] of 2 [0.5-3] vs 1 [0-2], P=.037).
      Vitamin D deficiency was associated with RTOG grade of >/=2, independent of
      possible confounding factors; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 3.07
      (1.27-7.50), P=.013. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with
      increased severity of radiation-induced acute proctitis. Investigating the
      underlying mechanisms of this association and evaluating the effectiveness of
      vitamin D therapy in preventing radiation-induced acute proctitis is warranted.

AB  - Genomic instability can initiate cancer, augment progression, and influence the
      overall prognosis of the affected patient. Genomic instability arises from many
      different pathways, such as telomere damage, centrosome amplification, epigenetic
      modifications, and DNA damage from endogenous and exogenous sources, and can be
      perpetuating, or limiting, through the induction of mutations or aneuploidy, both
      enabling and catastrophic. Many cancer treatments induce DNA damage to impair
      cell division on a global scale but it is accepted that personalized treatments, 
      those that are tailored to the particular patient and type of cancer, must also
      be developed. In this review, we detail the mechanisms from which genomic
      instability arises and can lead to cancer, as well as treatments and measures
      that prevent genomic instability or take advantage of the cellular defects caused
      by genomic instability. In particular, we identify and discuss five priority
      targets against genomic instability: (1) prevention of DNA damage; (2)
      enhancement of DNA repair; (3) targeting deficient DNA repair; (4) impairing
      centrosome clustering; and, (5) inhibition of telomerase activity. Moreover, we
      highlight vitamin D and B, selenium, carotenoids, PARP inhibitors, resveratrol,
      and isothiocyanates as priority approaches against genomic instability. The
      prioritized target sites and approaches were cross validated to identify
      potential synergistic effects on a number of important areas of cancer biology.

TI  - The comparison between vitamin d concentration in upper silesia patients with
      prostate cancer and with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
PG  - 207-11
AB  - A number of studies have shown that vitamin D has a protective effect against the
      development of cancer, which may also be related to prostate cancer. Low serum
      vitamin D concentration has also been demonstrated in benign prostate
      hyperplasia. We compared serum vitamin D concentration in two groups of Polish
      men with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. Each group comprised 30
      patients. The concentration was determined by ELISA. To assess the difference
      between the study population, non-parametric Mann Whitney U test was used. The
      results revealed that patients with prostate cancer are deficient in vitamin D
      (median =25.3, quartiles q1 - q3: 13.4 -33.4). The concentration of vitamin D in 
      the group of patients with prostate cancer was lower than in the group of benign 
      prostatic hyperplasia with vitamin D deficiency (median =34.8, quartiles q1 - q3:
      17.9 44.3). Vitamin D concentration in Polish men with prostate cancer is lower
      compared to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

TI  - Both serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium levels may increase the risk of
      incident prostate cancer in Caribbean men of African ancestry.
PG  - 925-35
LID - 10.1002/cam4.457 [doi]
AB  - Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations have been associated
      with both higher and lower risk of prostate cancer (PCa), whereas elevated levels
      of circulating calcium has been related to higher risks. However, there are few
      studies that account for effects of both calcium and 25(OH)D concentrations on
      incident PCa in a black population. We examined these relationships in a
      case-control study of men 40-80 years old with newly diagnosed, histologically
      confirmed PCa in Jamaica, a tropical country. Mean serum calcium concentrations
      was higher among cases (2.32 +/- 0.19 mmol/L) than controls, (2.27 +/- 0.30
      mmol/L) (P = 0.023) however, there were no differences in 25(OH)D by cancer
      status (cases, 33.67 +/- 12.71 ng/mL; controls (32.25 +/- 12.59 ng/mL). Serum
      calcium was not correlated with 25(OH)D (partial correlation: r, 0.06; P =
      0.287). Multivariable-adjusted models showed a positive linear relationship
      between PCa and serum calcium (OR, 1.12; CI, 1.00-1.25 per 0.1 nmol/L). Serum
      25(OH)D concentration also showed a positive association with PCa (OR, 1.23; CI, 
      1.01-1.49 per 10 ng/mL). The odds of PCa in men with serum 25(OH)D tertile 2 was 
      OR, 2.18; CI, 1.04-4.43 and OR, 2.47 CI, 1.20-4.90 for tertile 3 (P(trend) =
      0.013). Dietary intakes of calcium showed no relationship with PCa. Despite the
      strong relationship between serum calcium and vitamin D the mechanism by which
      each affects prostate cancer risk in men of African ancestry needs additional
      investigation.

AB  - CONTEXT: There is increasing evidence that Vitamin D (Vit D) and its metabolites,
      besides their well-known calcium-related functions, may also exert
      antiproliferative, pro-differentiating, and immune modulatory effects on tumor
      cells in vitro and may also delay tumor growth in vivo. OBJECTIVE: The aim of
      this review is to provide fresh insight into the most recent advances on the role
      of Vit D and its analogues as chemopreventive drugs in cancer therapy. METHODS: A
      systematic review of experimental and clinical studies on Vit D and cancer was
      undertaken by using the major electronic health database including ISI Web of
      Science, Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:
      Experimental and clinical observations suggest that Vit D and its analogues may
      be effective in preventing the malignant transformation and/or the progression of
      various types of human tumors including breast cancer, prostate cancer,
      colorectal cancer, and some hematological malignances. These findings suggest the
      possibility of the clinical use of these molecules as novel potential
      chemopreventive and anticancer agents.

TI  - [Measurements of PSA and of vitamin D: a period of 3-months of use of special
      forms based on the guidelines of the Haute autorite de sante shows a clear
      improvement of prescription behaviors].
PG  - 255-8
LID - 10.1684/abc.2015.1038 [doi]
AB  - In France practice guidelines of the Haute Autorite de sante (HAS) are not
      implemented as often as they should. As a consequence resources are wasted that
      could be useful elsewhere. In Avril 2014 prescription-forms were introduced in
      our hospital for PSA and for vitamin-D. If those forms were not filled-in by the 
      physicians, then PSA and vitamin-D were not measured any more by our laboratory. 
      PSA was measured in only two circumstances: therapeutic follow-up of, or
      screening for, prostate cancer. Patients had to give their formal consent for
      being screened with PSA. Vitamin-D was measured in the only six circumstances
      recommended by the HAS. After a few months of use of these two forms we observe a
      sharp decrease in PSA, and even more so in vitamin D, measurements. Our
      prescription-forms' legitimacy is high because they are based on governmental
      guidelines. All the more since the values that are promoted in these guidelines
      clearly cover the four core principles of bioethics, that is beneficence,
      non-malevolence, respect for the patient's autonomy (particularly for PSA) and
      equity. Our results need to be confirmed over a longer period of time, and to be 
      analysed in more detail, particularly regarding the way consent forms are
      filled-in by the patients.

TI  - The Fok1 vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism and 25(OH) D serum levels and
      prostate cancer among Jordanian men.
PG  - 2227-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms
      and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the Western world. Vitamin
      D (1,25dihydroxy vitamin D) is linked to many biological processes that influence
      oncogenesis but data on relations between its genetic variants and cancer risk
      have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to determine associations
      between a vitamin D genetic polymorphism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels
      and prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 124
      Jordanian prostate cancer patients and 100 healthy volunteers. Ethical approval
      was granted from the ethical committee at Hashemite University and written
      consent was given by all patients. PCR was used to amplify the vitamin D receptor
      Fok1 polymorphism fragment. 25(OH)D serum levels were measured by competitive
      immunoassay. RESULTS: All genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genotype 
      frequency for Fok1 genotypes FF, Ff and ff was 30.7%, 61.3% and 8.06%, for
      prostate cancer patients, while frequencies for the control group was 28.0%,
      66.0% and 6.0%, respectively, with no significant differences. Vitamin D serum
      level was significantly lower in prostate cancer patients (mean 7.7 ng/ml)
      compared to the control group (21.8 ng/ml). No significant association was noted 
      between 25(OH)D and VDR Fok1 gene polymorphism among Jordanians overall, but
      significant associations were evident among prostate cancer patients (FF, Ff and 
      ff : 25(OH)D levels of 6.2, 8.2 and 9.9) and controls (19.0, 22.5 and 26.3,
      respectively). An inverse association was noted between 25(OH)D serum level less 
      than 10 ng/ml and prostate cancer risk (OR 35.5 and 95% CI 14.3- 88.0).
      CONCLUSIONS: There is strong inverse association between 25(OH)D serum level less
      than 10 ng/ml level and prostate cancer risk.

AB  - Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men with > 1,100,000 
      new cases and 300,000 deaths worldwide each year. The disease is more common
      among older men, with a median age at diagnosis around age above 60 years.
      Prostate cancer is a major medical problem that needs immediate attention as the 
      disease is indolent, shows prolonged latency in association with high morbidity
      and mortality. Administration of diagnostic tests including PSA test and biopsies
      and the advances in other diagnostic procedures have led to early detection of
      the disease with therapeutic steps being taken early on, there has been a steady 
      decline in the disease-specific mortality. Global incidence and mortality rates
      show that the disease is more prevalent among black people, even though the
      differences cannot be attributed entirely to race, as the influence of
      socioeconomic situation and the resultant limited access to medical technologies 
      and treatment could not be ruled out completely. Several genes have been
      identified that when mutated confer high risk for the disease. Besides the
      genetic factors, family history and nutritional factors such as lack of enough
      vitamin D, high intake of calcium, obesity and high fat diets have been
      implicated as risk factors for prostate cancer. Therapeutic measures for prostate
      cancer involve mostly radical prostatectomy followed by radiotherapy in
      combination with hormonal treatment as needed.

TI  - The association between pre-treatment serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and survival in
      newly diagnosed stage IV prostate cancer.
PG  - e0119690
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0119690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Emerging evidence in the literature suggests a positive
      association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a standard indicator of 
      vitamin D status, and survival in certain types of cancer. We investigated this
      relationship in newly diagnosed stage IV prostate cancer patients. METHODS: A
      consecutive cohort of 125 newly diagnosed stage IV prostate cancer patients
      underwent a baseline serum 25(OH)D evaluation prior to receiving any treatment at
      our institution between January 2008 and December 2011. We used the vitamin D
      categories of "deficient (<20 ng/ml)", "insufficient (20 to 32 ng/ml)", and
      "sufficient (>32 ng/ml)". Cox regression was used to evaluate the prognostic
      significance of serum 25(OH)D after adjusting for relevant confounders. RESULTS: 
      Mean age at diagnosis was 60 years. Of the 125 patients, 32 (25.6%) were
      deficient, 49 (39.2%) were insufficient and 44 (35.2%) were sufficient in vitamin
      D at the time of diagnosis. The median survival in deficient, insufficient and
      sufficient cohorts was 47.8, 44.0 and 52.6 months respectively (p = 0.60). On
      univariate analysis, four variables demonstrated a statistically significant
      association with survival: nutritional status, bone metastasis, corrected serum
      calcium and serum albumin (p<0.05 for all). On multivariate analysis, five
      variables demonstrated statistically significant associations with survival:
      hospital location, age, bone metastasis, serum albumin and corrected serum
      calcium (p<0.05 for all). Serum vitamin D status was not significant on either
      univariate or multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previously published
      research, we found no significant association between pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D
      and survival in newly diagnosed stage IV prostate cancer patients. The lack of a 
      significant association between serum vitamin D and survival in our study could
      perhaps be due to the fact that the disease was far too advanced in our patients 
      for vitamin D levels to have any impact on prognosis.

TI  - Vitamin D receptor genetic polymorphisms are associated with PSA level, Gleason
      score and prostate cancer risk in African-American men.
PG  - 1549-58
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Several studies have revealed an association between single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene and prostate cancer (PCa) risk in
      European and Asian populations. To investigate whether VDR SNPs are associated
      with PCa risk in African-American (AA) men, nine VDR SNPs were analyzed in a
      case-control study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple and binary logistic
      regression models were applied to analyze the clinical and genotypic data.
      RESULTS: rs731236 and rs7975232 were significantly associated with PCa risk
      (p<0.05). In the analysis of clinical phenotypes, rs731236, rs1544410 and
      rs3782905 were strongly associated with high PSA level (p<0.05), whereas
      rs1544410 and rs2239185 showed a statistically significant association with high 
      Gleason score (p<0.05). Haplotype analysis revealed several VDR haplotypes
      associated with PCa risk. Additionally, a trend existed, where as the number of
      risk alleles increased in the haplotype, the greater was the association with
      risk (p-trend=0.01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the VDR SNPs may be
      associated with PCa risk and other clinical phenotypes of PCa in AA men.

TI  - Circulating vitamin D, vitamin D-related genetic variation, and risk of fatal
      prostate cancer in the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer
      Cohort Consortium.
PG  - 1949-56
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence from experimental animal and cell line studies supports a
      beneficial role for vitamin D in prostate cancer (PCa). Although the results from
      human studies have been mainly null for overall PCa risk, there may be a benefit 
      for survival. This study assessed the associations of circulating
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and common variations in key vitamin D-related
      genes with fatal PCa. METHODS: In a large cohort consortium, 518 fatal cases and 
      2986 controls with 25(OH)D data were identified. Genotyping information for 91
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 7 vitamin D-related genes (vitamin D
      receptor, group-specific component, cytochrome P450 27A1 [CYP27A1], CYP27B1,
      CYP24A1, CYP2R1, and retinoid X receptor alpha) was available for 496 fatal cases
      and 3577 controls. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds
      ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of 25(OH)D
      and SNPs with fatal PCa. The study also tested for 25(OH)D-SNP interactions among
      264 fatal cases and 1169 controls. RESULTS: No statistically significant
      relationship was observed between 25(OH)D and fatal PCa (OR for extreme
      quartiles, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.65-1.14; P for trend = .22) or the main effects of the
      SNPs and fatal PCa. There was evidence suggesting that associations of several
      SNPs, including 5 related to circulating 25(OH)D, with fatal PCa were modified by
      25(OH)D. Individually, these associations did not remain significant after
      multiple testing; however, the P value for the set-based test for CYP2R1 was
      .002. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant associations were not observed for
      either 25(OH)D or vitamin D-related SNPs with fatal PCa. The effect modification 
      of 25(OH)D associations by biologically plausible genetic variation may deserve
      further exploration.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that regular consumption of
      fruits and vegetables is strongly associated with reduced risk of developing
      chronic diseases, such as cancer. It is now accepted that the actions of any
      specific phytonutrient alone do not explain the observed health benefits of diets
      rich in fruits and vegetables as nutrients that were taken alone in clinical
      trials did not show consistent preventive effects. The considerable cost and
      complexity of such clinical trials requires prudent selection of combinations of 
      ingredients rather than single compounds. Indeed, synergistic inhibition of
      prostate and mammary cancer cell growth was evident when using combinations of
      low concentrations of various carotenoids or carotenoids with retinoic acid and
      the active metabolite of vitamin-D. In this study we aimed to develop simple and 
      sensitive in vitro methods which provide information on potent combinations
      suitable for inclusion in clinical studies for cancer prevention. We, thus, used 
      reporter gene assays of the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor in 
      hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells and of the electrophile/antioxidant
      response element (EpRE/ARE) transcription system. We found that combinations of
      several carotenoids (e.g., lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene), or carotenoids
      and polyphenols (e.g., carnosic acid and curcumin) and/or other compounds (e.g., 
      vitamin E) synergistically inhibit the androgen receptor activity and activate
      the EpRE/ARE system. The activation of EpRE/ARE was up to four fold higher than
      the sum of the activities of the single ingredients, a robust hallmark of
      synergy. Such combinations can further be tested in the more complex in vivo
      models and human studies.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of mortality in US men and the
      prevalence continues to rise world-wide especially in countries where men consume
      a 'Western-style' diet. Epidemiologic, preclinical and clinical studies suggest a
      potential role for dietary intake on the incidence and progression of PCa. 'This 
      minireview provides an overview of recent published literature with regard to
      nutrients, dietary factors, dietary patterns and PCa incidence and progression.
      Low carbohydrates intake, soy protein, omega-3 (w-3) fat, green teas, tomatoes
      and tomato products and zyflamend showed promise in reducing PCa risk or
      progression. A higher saturated fat intake and a higher beta-carotene status may 
      increase risk. A 'U' shape relationship may exist between folate, vitamin C,
      vitamin D and calcium with PCa risk. Despite the inconsistent and inconclusive
      findings, the potential for a role of dietary intake for the prevention and
      treatment of PCa is promising. The combination of all the beneficial factors for 
      PCa risk reduction in a healthy dietary pattern may be the best dietary advice.
      This pattern includes rich fruits and vegetables, reduced refined carbohydrates, 
      total and saturated fats, and reduced cooked meats. Further carefully designed
      prospective trials are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified SNPs in 
      or near four genes related to circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
      concentration. To examine the hypothesized inverse relationship between vitamin D
      status and breast cancer, we studied the associations between SNPs in these genes
      and breast cancer risk in a large pooled study of 9,456 cases and 10,816 controls
      from six cohorts. METHODS: SNP markers localized to each of four genes (GC,
      CYP24A1, CYP2R1, and DHCR7) previously associated with 25(OH)D were genotyped and
      examined both individually and as a 4-SNP polygenic score. Logistic regression
      was used to estimate the associations between the genetic variants and risk of
      breast cancer. RESULTS: We found no association between any of the four SNPs or
      their polygenic score and breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not
      support an association between vitamin D status, as reflected by 25(OH)D-related 
      genotypes, and breast cancer risk. IMPACT: These findings may contribute to
      future meta-analyses and scientific review articles, and provide new data about
      the association between vitamin D-related genes and breast cancer. Cancer

AB  - The study determined prostate cancer specialists' knowledge and concordance to
      guidelines regarding the diagnosis, management, and prevention of androgen
      deprivation therapy-induced osteoporosis. Despite high knowledge regarding bone
      health, most respondents did not routinely measure bone mineral density or use
      fracture risk assessment tools, suggesting a significant gap in the
      screening/monitoring of bone health. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was 
      to determine prostate cancer specialists' knowledge, practices, self-perceived
      competencies and barriers to providing guideline-concordant care in the
      diagnosis, prevention, and management of androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT)-induced osteoporosis (OP). METHODS: A number of 73 Canadian radiation
      oncologists and 83 urologists completed questionnaires assessing (i) knowledge
      regarding OP and consensus guidelines for bone health management in men receiving
      ADT, (ii) self-assessed competencies regarding bone health management, (iii)
      current practices regarding OP prevention and management, and (iv) self-perceived
      barriers to providing guideline-concordant care. RESULTS: The majority of
      respondents were able to correctly identify the guideline-concordant frequency of
      repeat dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans (76.3%), vitamin D (70.3%),
      and calcium (53.2%) intake and that bisphosphonates/denosumab should always be
      considered for patients with a history of one low-trauma fracture (57.6%). Just
      under 1/3 (32.5%) reported routinely measuring bone mineral density (BMD) prior
      to starting ADT and routinely measuring BMD 1-2 years following the initiation of
      ADT (36.6%). Only 4.6% of respondents routinely used a validated fracture risk
      assessment tool. Lowest self-assessed competency levels were reported in
      providing self-management education to patients to foster the uptake of healthy
      bone behaviors (HBBs) and managing patients who present with or develop
      osteopenia and OP. The most significant barriers to providing OP prevention and
      management were lack of time and lack of supporting structures. CONCLUSIONS:
      Despite high knowledge about appropriate bone health care among prostate cancer
      specialists, there remain significant gaps in screening and monitoring of bone
      health, suggesting the need to develop innovative strategies to overcome barriers
      to implementation.

TI  - Health outcomes of vitamin D. Part II. Role in prevention of diseases.
PG  - 273-9
AB  - Apart from the classic role of vitamin D, its hormonal active form, calcitriol is
      also characterized by pleiotropic effects on various organs and tissues. For the 
      last several years, many researchers have shown an association between deficiency
      of vitamin D and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent
      investigations suggested the need of vitamin D supplementation in T2DM
      prevention. It was shown that vitamin D deficiency decreases insulin secretion.
      It was also observed that proper vitamin D supplementation may improve the
      ability of the cells of the islets of Langerhans to synthesize many proteins de
      novo and to convert proinsulin to insulin. Apart from regulating bone metabolism 
      and also calcium and phosphate homeostasis, 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts antiproliferative 
      and pro-differentiating effects on a wide variety of cell types. It also induces 
      apoptosis of cancer cells and slows their proliferation. In a number of major
      studies the relationship between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of
      various cancers was observed. It concerns colorectal, lung, prostate, breast and 
      ovarian cancer. It was observed that in patients with low serum vitamin D
      concentrations such disorders as ischemic heart disease, heart attack, stroke,
      cardiac arrhythmia, and hypertension were more frequent and mortality was
      significantly higher. These results led the researchers to consider vitamin D
      deficiency as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The possible
      mechanism in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases that may be related to
      low levels of vitamin D, is its adverse effect on the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Calcitriol is also an important
      determinant of muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as
      inhibition of apoptosis. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin. However, there are
      only a few food products that are rich in vitamin D3, e.g.: fish oils, fish and
      fortified-products, such as dairy products and margarines. Individuals who are
      vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency should be supplemented. KEY WORDS: vitamin D, 
      diabetes mellitus, deficiency of vitamin D, cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
      muscle physiology.

      pharmacogenetic research recently. Association studies between different types of
      cancers including prostate cancer (PCa) and VDR gene polymorphism have also been 
      conducted. The objective of this study was to find possible associations between 
      PCa and VDR gene polymorphisms in the Pakistani population. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 162 subjects, including prostate cancer patients and
      controls, were genotyped for Apa I, Taq I and Fok I polymorphisms in the VDR gene
      using allele specific PCR, PCR-RFLP and direct DNA sequencing. Allelic
      frequencies were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and associations between
      the genetic markers and PCa were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS:
      Apa I CC genotype was found to have strongest association with PCa risk, and "A" 
      genotype was found to have protective effect. Fok I and Taq I did not have
      appreciable levels of association with PCa, although Taq I "TC" heterozygotes
      seemed to have some protective effect. Similarly the "C" allele of Fok I also
      seemed to have protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the
      first report showing association between VDR gene polymorphisms and PCa in
      Pakistan. Our findings may be somewhat skewed because of small sample size and
      tendency of consanguineous marriages in Pakistani society; nevertheless, it shows
      the trend of association and protective effects of certain VDR gene polymorphisms
      against PCa.

TI  - VDR regulation of microRNA differs across prostate cell models suggesting
      extremely flexible control of transcription.
PG  - 40-9

AB  - The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and 
      is of therapeutic interest in cancer and other settings. Regulation of microRNA
      (miRNA) by the VDR appears to be important to mediate its actions, for example,
      to control cell growth. To identify if and to what extent VDR-regulated miRNA
      patterns change in prostate cancer progression, we undertook miRNA microarray
      analyses in 7 cell models representing non-malignant and malignant prostate cells
      (RWPE-1, RWPE-2, HPr1, HPr1AR, LNCaP, LNCaP-C4-2, and PC-3). To focus on primary 
      VDR regulatory events, we undertook expression analyses after 30 minutes
      treatment with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. Across all models, 111 miRNAs were significantly
      modulated by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Of these, only 5 miRNAs were modulated
      in more than one cell model, and of these, only 3 miRNAs were modulated in the
      same direction. The patterns of miRNA regulation, and the networks they targeted,
      significantly distinguished the different cell types. Integration of
      1alpha,25(OH)2D3-regulated miRNAs with published VDR ChIP-seq data showed
      significant enrichment of VDR peaks in flanking regions of miRNAs. Furthermore,
      mRNA and miRNA expression analyses in non-malignant RWPE-1 cells revealed
      patterns of miRNA and mRNA co-regulation; specifically, 13 significant reciprocal
      patterns were identified and these patterns were also observed in TCGA prostate
      cancer data. Lastly, motif search analysis revealed differential motif enrichment
      within VDR peaks flanking mRNA compared to miRNA genes. Together, this study
      revealed that miRNAs are rapidly regulated in a highly cell-type specific manner,
      and are significantly co-integrated with mRNA regulation.

TI  - Associations of vitamin D pathway genes with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin-D,
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D, and prostate cancer: a nested case-control study.
PG  - 205-18
LID - 10.1007/s10552-014-0500-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vitamin D pathway single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are potentially
      useful proxies for investigating whether circulating vitamin D metabolites [total
      25-hydroxyvitamin-D, 25(OH)D; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin, 1,25(OH)2D] are causally
      related to prostate cancer. We investigated associations of sixteen SNPs across
      seven genes with prostate-specific antigen-detected prostate cancer. METHODS: In 
      a nested case-control study (within the ProtecT trial), we estimated odds ratios 
      and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) quantifying associations between SNPs and
      prostate cancer. Subgroup analyses investigated whether associations were
      stronger in men who had high/low sun exposure [a proxy for 25(OH)D]. We
      quantified associations of SNPs with stage (T1-T2/T3-T4) and grade (<7/>/=7).
      Multiple variant scores included SNPs encoding proteins involved in 25(OH)D
      synthesis and metabolism. RESULTS: We included 1,275 prostate cancer cases (141
      locally advanced, 385 high grades) and 2,062 healthy controls. Vitamin D-binding 
      protein SNPs were associated with prostate cancer (rs4588-A: OR 1.20, CI 1.01,
      1.41, p = 0.04; rs7041-T: OR 1.19, CI 1.02, 1.38, p = 0.03). Low 25(OH)D
      metabolism score was associated with high (vs low) grade (OR 0.76, CI 0.63, 0.93,
      p = 0.01); there was a similar association of its component variants: rs6013897-A
      in CYP24A1 (OR 0.78, CI 0.60, 1.01, p = 0.06) and rs10877012-T in CYP27B1 (OR
      0.80, CI 0.63, 1.02, p = 0.07). There was no evidence that associations differed 
      by level of sun exposure. CONCLUSION: We found some evidence that vitamin D
      pathway SNPs were associated with prostate cancer risk and grade, but not stage. 
      There was no evidence of an association in men with deficient vitamin D (measured
      by having low sun exposure).

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subset of cells that may be responsible for 
      initiation, progression, and recurrence of tumors. Recent studies have
      demonstrated that CSCs are highly tumorigenic and resistant to conventional
      chemotherapies, making them a promising target for the development of
      preventive/therapeutic agents. A single or combination of various markers, such
      as CD44, EpCAM, CD49f, CD133, CXCR4, ALDH-1, and CD24, were utilized to isolate
      CSCs from various types of human cancers. Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt, and TGF-beta
      signalingregulate self-renewal and differentiation of normal stem cells andare
      aberrantly activated in CSCs. In addition, many studies have demonstrated that
      these stem cell-associated signaling pathways are required for the maintenance of
      CSCs in different malignancies, including breast, colorectal, prostate, and
      pancreatic cancers. Accumulating evidence has shown inhibitory effects of vitamin
      D and its analogs on the cancer stem cell signaling pathways, suggesting vitamin 
      D as a potential preventive/therapeutic agent against CSCs. In this review, we
      summarize recent findings about the roles of Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt, and TGF-beta
      signaling in CSCs as well as the effects of vitamin D on these stem cell
      signaling pathways. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled '17th
      Vitamin D Workshop'.

TI  - Use of tanning potential as a predictor for prostate cancer risk in
      African-American men.
PG  - 1181-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vitamin D deficiency in African-Americans is common due to the
      high melanin content of the skin that reduces the absorption of UV radiation. To 
      determine if there is a correlation between UV exposure, tanning potential and
      vitamin D with prostate cancer (PC) risk, we conducted a case-control study of
      183 African-American men aged 40 years and older residing in the Washington, DC
      area. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PC status was described as a binary variable as the
      presence or absence of cancer and the environmental factors as continuous
      variables. We used a logistic regression model describing PC as the response,
      while age, tanning potential, sunlight and vitamin D were treated as the
      predictors. RESULTS: Men aged 60 years and older had a seven-fold increased risk 
      for developing PC compared to those aged 50 years and less (p<0.003). Tanning
      potential was a significant (p=0.05) risk factor for PC, while sunlight exposure 
      and vitamin D were not. Tanning potential was also significant (p=0.044) when
      adjusted for vitamin D and age. However, tanning potential was only marginally
      significant when adjusted for sunlight exposure (p=0.064) CONCLUSION: The
      findings of this study indicate that tanning potential may be a predictor for PC 
      risk in African-American men.

TI  - The use of dietary supplements to alleviate androgen deprivation therapy side
      effects during prostate cancer treatment.
PG  - 4491-519
LID - 10.3390/nu6104491 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa), the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading
      cause of male cancer death in Western societies, is typically androgen-dependent,
      a characteristic that underlies the rationale of androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT). Approximately 90% of patients initially respond to ADT strategies, however
      many experience side effects including hot flashes, cardiotoxicity, metabolic and
      musculoskeletal alterations. This review summarizes pre-clinical and clinical
      studies investigating the ability of dietary supplements to alleviate adverse
      effects arising from ADT. In particular, we focus on herbal compounds,
      phytoestrogens, selenium (Se), fatty acids (FA), calcium, and Vitamins D and E.
      Indeed, there is some evidence that calcium and Vitamin D can prevent the
      development of osteoporosis during ADT. On the other hand, caution should be
      taken with the antioxidants Se and Vitamin E until the basis underlying their
      respective association with type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCa tumor development
      has been clarified. However, many other promising supplements have not yet been
      subjected large-scale clinical trials making it difficult to assess their
      efficacy. Given the demographic trend of increased PCa diagnoses and dependence
      on ADT as a major therapeutic strategy, further studies are required to
      objectively evaluate these supplements as adjuvant for PCa patients receiving
      ADT.

TI  - Differential expression and regulation of vitamin D hydroxylases and inflammatory
      genes in prostate stroma and epithelium by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in men with
      prostate cancer and an in vitro model.

AB  - Previous work on vitamin D in the prostate has focused on the prostatic
      epithelium, from which prostate cancer arises. Prostatic epithelial cells are
      surrounded by stroma, which has well-established regulatory control over
      epithelial proliferation, differentiation, and the inflammatory response. Here we
      examined the regulation of vitamin D-related genes and inflammatory genes by
      1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D) in laser-capture microdissected
      prostate tissue from a vitamin D3 clinical trial and in an in vitro model that
      facilitates stromal-epithelial crosstalk. Analysis of the trial tissues showed
      that VDR was present in both cell types, whereas expression of the hydroxylases
      was the highest in the epithelium. Examination of gene expression by prostatic
      (1,25(OH)2D) concentrations showed that VDR was significantly lower in prostate
      tissues with the highest concentration of 1,25(OH)2D, and down-regulation of VDR 
      by 1,25(OH) 2D was confirmed in the primary cell cultures. Analysis of
      inflammatory genes in the patient tissues revealed that IL-6 expression was the
      highest in the prostate stroma while PTGS2 (COX2) levels were lowest in the
      prostate cancer tissues from men in the highest tertile of prostatic 1,25(OH)2D. 
      In vitro, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 were suppressed by 1,25 (OH)2D in the primary 
      epithelial cells, whereas TNF-alpha and PTGS2 were suppressed by 1,25(OH) 2D in
      the stromal cells. Importantly, the ability of 1,25(OH)2D to alter
      pro-inflammatory-induced changes in epithelial cell growth were dependent on the 
      presence of the stromal cells. In summary, whereas both stromal and epithelial
      cells of the prostate express VDR and can presumably respond to 1,25(OH)2D, the
      prostatic epithelium appears to be the main producer of 1,25(OH)2D. Further,
      while the prostate epithelium was more responsive to the anti-inflammatory
      activity of 1,25 (OH)2D than stromal cells, stroma-epithelial crosstalk enhanced 
      the phenotypic effects of 1,25(OH)2D and the inflammatory process in the prostate
      gland.

TI  - Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and cancer.
PG  - 69-105
AB  - It was suggested that vitamin D levels influence cancer development. The vitamin 
      D receptor (VDR) is a crucial mediator for the cellular effects of vitamin D. In 
      fact It has been hypothesized that polymorphisms in the VDR gene affect cancer
      risk and the relevance of VDR gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms for 
      various types of cancer has been investigated by a great number of studies.
      However, results from previous studies on the association of VDR polymorphisms
      with different cancer types are somewhat contradictory, and the role of VDR in
      the etiology of cancer is still equivocal. We have performed a systematic review 
      of the literature to analyze the relevance of more VDR polymorphisms (Fok1, Bsm1,
      Taq1, Apa1, and Cdx2) for individual malignancies, including cancer of the skin
      (melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer), ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma,
      bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, thyroid carcinoma, esophageal
      adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma, head and neck and oral
      squamous cell carcinoma. Up to June 2012, we identified 79 independent studies
      for a total of 52427 cases and 62225 controls. Significant associations with VDR 
      polymorphisms have been reported for prostate (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1), breast (Fok1,
      Bsm1, Apa1), colon-rectum (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1) and skin cancer (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1). 
      Very few studies reported risk estimates for the other cancer sites. Conflicting 
      data have been reported for most malignancies and at present it is still not
      possible to make any definitive statements about the importance of the VDR
      genotype for cancer risk. It seems probable that interactions with other factors 
      such as calcium and vitamin D intake, 25(OH)D plasma levels and UV radiation
      exposure play a decisive role in cancer risk. To conclude, there is some
      indication that VDR polymorphisms may modulate the risk of some cancer sites and 
      in future studies VDR genetic variation should be integrated also with
      prediagnostic indicator of vitamin D status.

TI  - Vitamin D status and cancer incidence and mortality.
PG  - 33-51
AB  - The role of vitamin D in cancer incidence and mortality has been investigated
      using several approaches, including using sun exposure as a proxy for vitamin D
      status, assessing vitamin D intake from food and supplements, using a predicted
      score to estimate vitamin D status, and directly measuring circulating 25(OH)D. A
      variety of complementary study designs have been implemented with various
      strengths and limitations. Although definitive randomized control trial data are 
      lacking, there is strong evidence for a protective relationship of vitamin D and 
      colorectal cancer incidence. Evidence for other cancers is not as consistent.
      More recently, large pooling projects have begun to investigate rarer cancers,
      studies have investigated common variation and expression of vitamin D-related
      genes and their relationships to cancer, and evidence has emerged on the role of 
      vitamin D in cancer survival. Further study is needed to answer important
      questions that remain about the most affected cancer sites, the timing of vitamin
      D exposure in relation cancer etiology duringthe life span (e.g., adolescence or 
      adulthood), the dose-response/optimal levels required for the most benefit, and
      which stages of carcinogenesis (e.g., incidence or progression) are most
      relevant.

TI  - Vitamin D and cancer: an overview on epidemiological studies.
PG  - 17-32
AB  - In recent years, a rapidly increasing number of studies have investigated the
      relationship of vitamin D with total cancer and site-specific cancer obtaining
      diverse findings. In this chapter we provide an overview of epidemiological
      studies of vitamin D intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
      serum levels and vitamin D associated polymorphisms in relation to total and
      site-specific cancer risk. Overall, epidemiological evidence for total cancer is 
      inconclusive. However, a large number of studies support a relationship of
      vitamin D with colorectal cancer and to a lesser extent with breast cancer.
      Findings are inconsistent for other cancers including all other gastrointestinal 
      cancers and prostate cancer. Different vitamin D associated polymorphisms were
      found to be significantly associated to colorectal, breast and prostate cancer
      risk.

      cancer in adults. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014, 6:CD007469].
PG  - 411-3
AB  - Vitamin D has been mentioned in the literature has a potentially important agent 
      for preventing the development of tumors, namely breast, colon, prostate and
      ovary tumors. However, the currently available evidence on the subject is
      contradictory and inconclusive. In this Cochrane systematic review, patients
      taking supplemental vitamin D on its various forms (cholecalciferol,
      ergocalciferol, alfacalcidol or calcitriol), regardless the dose, duration and
      route of administration, were compared with placebo, healthy adults without any
      intervention or adults with a disease in a stable phase, non-related with vitamin
      D metabolism. The results showed that currently, there is no firm evidence that
      vitamin D supplementation increases or decreases the risk of cancer occurrence,
      mainly in elderly community-dwelling women. Though at risk of type I errors due
      to small samples and substantial dropout of participants during the trials, the
      administration of supplemental cholecalciferol led to a 12% (CI 95%: 2 a 22%)
      decreased in cancer mortality, while the administration of supplemental vitamin D
      decreased all-cause mortality by 7% (CI 95%: 2 a 12%). The combined
      administration of supplements of cholecalciferol and calcium induced an increased
      incidence of nephrolithiasis.

TI  - Vitamin D3 regulates the formation and degradation of gap junctions in
      androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells.
PG  - e106437
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106437 [doi]
AB  - 1alpha-25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (1-25D), an active hormonal form of Vitamin D3, is a
      well-known chemopreventive and pro-differentiating agent. It has been shown to
      inhibit the growth of several prostate cancer cell lines. Gap junctions, formed
      of proteins called connexins (Cx), are ensembles of cell-cell channels, which
      permit the exchange of small growth regulatory molecules between adjoining cells.
      Cell-cell communication mediated by gap junctional channels is an important
      homeostatic control mechanism for regulating cell growth and differentiation. We 
      have investigated the effect of 1-25D on the formation and degradation of gap
      junctions in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, which
      expresses retrovirally-introduced Cx32. Connexin32 is expressed by the luminal
      and well-differentiated cells of normal prostate and prostate tumors. Our results
      document that 1-25D enhances the expression of Cx32 and its subsequent assembly
      into gap junctions. Our results further show that 1-25D prevents
      androgen-regulated degradation of Cx32, post-translationally, independent of
      androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signaling. Finally, our findings document that
      formation of gap junctions sensitizes Cx32-expressing LNCaP cells to the growth
      inhibitory effects of 1-25D and alters their morphology. These findings suggest
      that the growth-inhibitory effects of 1-25D in LNCaP cells may be related to its 
      ability to modulate the assembly of Cx32 into gap junctions.

TI  - How I do it: managing bone health in patients with prostate cancer.
PG  - 7399-403
AB  - Urologists have two scenarios where they have to address bone loss or increased
      risk of fractures in men with prostate cancer. In the first setting, a patient
      who has been started on androgen deprivation therapy may develop
      cancer-treatment-induced bone loss. In the second setting, a patient's prostate
      cancer may have metastasized to the bone. This article describes six steps to
      manage bone health in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in a community
      practice.

TI  - Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D binding protein and risk of colorectal
      cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.
PG  - E654-64
LID - 10.1002/ijc.29157 [doi]
AB  - The potential role of vitamin D in cancer prevention has generated substantial
      interest, and laboratory experiments indicate several anti-cancer properties for 
      vitamin D compounds. Prospective studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      [25(OH)D], the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, suggest an inverse
      association with colorectal cancer risk, but with some inconsistencies.
      Furthermore, the direct or indirect impact of the key transport protein, vitamin 
      D binding protein (DBP), has not been examined. We conducted a prospective study 
      of serum 25(OH)D and DBP concentrations and colorectal cancer risk in the
      Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, based on 476
      colorectal cancer cases and 476 controls, matched on age, sex, race and date of
      serum collection. All subjects underwent sigmoidoscopic screening at baseline and
      once during follow-up. Conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios
      (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Circulating 25(OH)D was inversely
      associated with colorectal cancer (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.94 for highest versus
      lowest quintile, p trend 0.01). Adjusting for recognized colorectal cancer risk
      factors and accounting for seasonal vitamin D variation did not alter the
      findings. Neither circulating DBP nor the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio, a proxy for
      free circulating 25(OH)D, was associated with risk (OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54-1.26, 
      and OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.21, respectively), and DBP did not modify the
      25(OH)D association. The current study eliminated confounding by colorectal
      cancer screening behavior, and supports an association between higher vitamin D
      status and substantially lower colorectal cancer risk, but does not indicate a
      direct or modifying role for DBP.

PG  - 601-7
LID - 10.1097/MOU.0000000000000101 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains a common treatment 
      for prostate cancer, even in the nonmetastatic setting and in scenarios without
      evidence of efficacy. Increasing attention has focused on its adverse effects, of
      which bone disease in the form of osteoporosis and fractures has been one of the 
      major concerns. Recently published articles are reviewed, focusing on ADT effects
      on bone and management of ADT-associated bone disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A range
      of strategies directed at ADT-associated bone disease are available, including
      antiresorptive agents such as denosumab and bisphosphonates, as well as
      complementary approaches such as calcium and vitamin D supplementation, exercise 
      regimens, and multifaceted interventions incorporating several approaches. Most
      interventions used bone mineral density as a surrogate outcome, despite
      compelling evidence that it inadequately captures fracture risk. SUMMARY: The
      antiresorptive agents are clearly able to preserve bone mineral density in men on
      ADT, whereas other approaches have modest to no benefits. Unfortunately, despite 
      intense research interest in this area, no approach has yet demonstrated a
      definitive and convincing reduction in clinically relevant fracture outcomes.
      This emphasizes the importance of restricting the use of ADT to settings in which
      its benefits are clearly established, in order to limit unnecessary
      complications.

TI  - Breast cancer--new aspects of tumor biology: are calcitriol and cyclooxygenase-2 
      possible targets for breast cancer?
PG  - 341-58
AB  - Up until now there have been many advances in treatment options for breast
      cancers such as targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors, mTOR antagonists, and vaccines. Despite these advances, there are
      still many more that warrant further exploration. Two of these targets might be
      the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the key enzyme required to convert arachidonic acid
      to prostaglandins, and calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3] which is the biologically active 
      form of vitamin D. Both calcitriol and the inhibition of COX-2 have shown
      antiproliferative and prodifferentiation, as well as pro-apoptotic effects in
      different malignancies in vitro and in vivo, and the key prostaglandin catabolic 
      enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is known to have tumor
      suppressor activity. Furthermore, the combination ofcalcitriol and nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as non-selective and selective COX-2
      inhibitors, acting synergistically to achieve significant cell growth inhibition 
      in prostate cancer. Some epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D confers a
      moderate benefit against breast cancer while most epidemiological studies presume
      that NSAIDs confer the same. Nevertheless there is growing body of evidence that 
      COX-2 expression is a fundamental step in breast cancer carcinogenesis. To date, 
      clinical trials have been conducted in patients with different malignancies using
      treatment strategies including COX-2 inhibitors and calcitriol and are showing
      partially encouraging results. The goal of this review is to shed light on the
      association between the prostaglandin as well as vitamin D metabolism relating to
      the incidence and therapy of breast cancers. Moreover, this review will also
      highlight potential treatment options, as well as extract any existing
      interactions between the two metabolisms.

TI  - Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of prostate cancer: results
      from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.
PG  - 1484-93
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-1340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have reported inconsistent associations of
      vitamin D and prostate cancer risk; however, few have adequately controlled for
      detection bias related to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, and the
      results of many studies may be affected by occult prostate cancers among
      controls. METHODS: Data for this nested case-control analysis (n = 1,695
      cases/1,682 controls) are from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Baseline
      serum was analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The presence or absence of 
      cancer was subsequently determined by prostate biopsy. Polytomous logistic
      regression models were used to estimate associations of 25(OH)D with risk of
      total, Gleason 2-6, Gleason 7, and Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer. Results are
      presented for placebo and finasteride arms separately and combined. RESULTS:
      There were no associations of serum 25(OH)D with total prostate cancer risk. For 
      Gleason 2-6 cancers, results were inconsistent across treatment arms with a
      suggestion of increased risk in the placebo arm only; however, there was no
      dose-response relationship. For Gleason 8-10 prostate cancers, 25(OH)D
      concentrations were associated with a linear decrease in risk among combined
      treatment arms [quartile 4 vs. 1: OR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI),
      0.32-0.94; P(trend) = 0.04]. These findings were somewhat stronger among men
      >/=65 versus 55-64 years at baseline (quartile 4 vs. 1: OR, 0.40; 95% CI,
      0.18-0.88 vs. OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.35-1.52, respectively; P(interaction) = 0.52). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum 25(OH)D may modestly increase risk of Gleason 2-6
      disease and more substantially reduce risk of Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer.
      IMPACT: Vitamin D may have different effects for different stages of prostate
      cancers.

      In the SELECT study, plasma 25-OHD levels were associated with a linear decrease 
      in prostate cancer risk for high-grade cancers in African American men and an
      apparent "U"-shaped effect in other men. The "U-shaped" curve may reflect
      detection bias. In the PCPT study, in which detection bias was minimized, serum
      25-OHD levels were associated with a linear decrease in the risk of high-grade
      prostate cancers. The results from these large prevention trials support the
      hypothesis that circulating levels of 25-OHD decrease the risk of clinically
      relevant prostate cancers.

PG  - 565393
LID - 10.1155/2014/565393 [doi]
AB  - Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody used for prevention of skeletal-related events
      (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. Hypocalcemia is a rare
      and dangerous side effect of the drug Denosumab. We present a case of a patient
      with metastatic prostate cancer who developed severe hypocalcemia after the
      administration of the drug. The patient's vitamin D levels were low when checked 
      after administration of the drug, which likely predisposed him to the development
      of hypocalcemia. He was placed on high doses of oral and intravenous (IV) calcium
      and vitamin D without any appreciable response in the serum calcium level. His
      ionized calcium remained below 0.71 mmol/L despite very high doses of oral and IV
      calcium supplements. During the hospital course, he developed hydronephrosis from
      the spread of a tumor and did not want to undergo percutaneous nephrostomy tube
      placement; therefore, it was decided to dialyse him for acute renal failure and
      to correct his hypocalcemia. Checking calcium and vitamin D levels prior to the
      administration of Denosumab is vital in preventing hypocalcemia. If hypocalcemia 
      is severe and not responsive to high doses of vitamin D, oral and IV calcium,
      then hemodialysis with a high calcium bath can correct this electrolyte
      abnormality.

TI  - Vitamin D and miRNAs in cancer.
PG  - 269-75
AB  - Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that regulates mineral homeostasis, bone
      metabolism and many other physiological processes. The active metabolite of
      vitamin D, 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D(3)), has broad spectrum antitumor
      activities and potentiates the effects of a number of chemotherapeutic agents.
      1,25D(3) exerts its anti-tumor effects mainly through genomic mechanisms
      involving the regulation of gene transcription through vitamin D response
      elements (VDREs). More recently, miRNAs have been shown to be regulated by
      1,25D(3). miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally modulate
      the expression of a wide range of genes. Therefore, they have important
      regulatory roles in the development and progression of many diseases including
      cancer. This review focuses on the regulation of miRNA expression by 1,25D(3) in 
      cancer model systems and the contribution of the regulated miRNAs to the
      anti-tumor effect of 1,25D(3). In addition, the impact of miRNAs on 1,25D(3)
      signaling is discussed.

TI  - Phase I safety and pharmacodynamic of inecalcitol, a novel VDR agonist with
      docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.
PG  - 4471-7
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3247 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a phase I multicenter trial in naive metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients with escalating inecalcitol dosages, 
      combined with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Inecalcitol is a novel vitamin D
      receptor agonist with higher antiproliferative effects and a 100-fold lower
      hypercalcemic activity than calcitriol. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Safety and efficacy 
      were evaluated in groups of three to six patients receiving inecalcitol during a 
      21-day cycle in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) and oral
      prednisone (5 mg twice a day) up to six cycles. Primary endpoint was
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) defined as grade 3 hypercalcemia within the first
      cycle. Efficacy endpoint was >/=30% PSA decline within 3 months. RESULTS: Eight
      dose levels (40-8,000 mug) were evaluated in 54 patients. DLT occurred in two of 
      four patients receiving 8,000 mug/day after one and two weeks of inecalcitol.
      Calcemia normalized a few days after interruption of inecalcitol. Two other
      patients reached grade 2, and the dose level was reduced to 4,000 mug. After dose
      reduction, calcemia remained within normal range and grade 1 hypercalcemia. The
      maximum tolerated dose was 4,000 mug daily. Respectively, 85% and 76% of the
      patients had >/=30% PSA decline within 3 months and >/=50% PSA decline at any
      time during the study. Median time to PSA progression was 169 days. CONCLUSION:
      High antiproliferative daily inecalcitol dose has been safely used in combination
      with docetaxel and shows encouraging PSA response (>/=30% PSA response: 85%;
      >/=50% PSA response: 76%). A randomized phase II study is planned.

PG  - 1944-7
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0522 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Black men exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as well
      as a higher incidence of prostate cancer and higher mortality rates from prostate
      cancer than Whites. There are few data about the effect of vitamin D3
      (cholecalciferol) supplementation on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in healthy
      Black men. METHODS: During three winters from 2007 to 2010, 105 Black men (median
      age, 48.9 years) of Boston, MA were randomized into a four-arm, double-blind
      trial for 3 months of placebo, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 U of vitamin D3. At
      baseline and 3 months, free and total PSA was measured. RESULTS: With vitamin D
      supplementation, no significant differences in free and total PSA were observed; 
      free PSA, -0.0004 ng/mL (P = 0.94) and total PSA, -0.004 ng/mL (P = 0.92) for
      each additional 1,000 U/d of vitamin D3. CONCLUSION: Within an unselected
      population of healthy Black men without a cancer diagnosis, we found no effect of
      vitamin D supplementation on free or total PSA. IMPACT: These findings support
      prior findings of no change in PSA with vitamin D supplementation and emphasize
      the need for new methods to assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation on 
      prostate cancer prevention.

TI  - In older men, lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with reduced
      incidence of prostate, but not colorectal or lung cancer.
PG  - e99954
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0099954 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate, colorectal and lung cancers are common in men.
      In this study, we aimed to determine whether vitamin D status is associated with 
      the incidence of these cancers in older men. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 4208 older men aged 70-88 years in Perth, Western
      Australia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
      concentration was measured by immunoassay. New diagnoses of prostate, colorectal 
      and lung cancers were determined via electronic record linkage. RESULTS: During a
      mean follow-up of 6.7+/-1.8 years, there were 315, 117 and 101 new diagnoses of
      prostate, colorectal and lung cancer. In multivariate competing risks
      proportional hazards models, every 10 nmol/l decrease in 25(OH)D concentration
      was associated with a 4% reduction in prostate cancer incidence (sub-hazard ratio
      [SHR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.00). Every halving of 25(OH)D
      concentration was associated with a 21% reduction in incident prostate cancer in 
      multivariate analysis (SHR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99). Following exclusion of
      prostate cancer cases diagnosed within 3 years of blood sampling, low 25(OH)D <50
      nmol/l was associated with lower incident prostate cancer, and higher 25(OH)D >75
      nmol/l was associated with higher incidence, when compared to the reference range
      50-75 nmol/l, respectively (p = 0.027). Significant associations were also
      observed when 25(OH)D was modeled as a quantitative variable. No associations
      were observed between plasma 25(OH)D concentration with incidence of colorectal
      or lung cancer. CONCLUSION: Lower levels of vitamin D may reduce prostate cancer 
      risk in older men. By contrast, levels of vitamin D did not predict incidence of 
      colorectal or lung cancers. Further studies are needed to determine whether a
      causal relationship exists between vitamin D and prostate cancer in ageing men.

TI  - The prostate cancer TMPRSS2:ERG fusion synergizes with the vitamin D receptor
      (VDR) to induce CYP24A1 expression-limiting VDR signaling.
PG  - 3262-73
LID - 10.1210/en.2013-2019 [doi]
AB  - A number of preclinical studies have shown that the activation of the vitamin D
      receptor (VDR) reduces prostate cancer (PCa) cell and tumor growth. The majority 
      of human PCas express a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2):erythroblast
      transformation-specific (ETS) fusion gene, but most preclinical studies have been
      performed in PCa models lacking TMPRSS2:ETS in part due to the limited
      availability of model systems expressing endogenous TMPRSS2:ETS. The level of the
      active metabolite of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), is
      controlled in part by VDR-dependent induction of cytochrome P450, family 24,
      subfamily 1, polypeptide1 (CYP24A1), which metabolizes 1,25D to an inactive form.
      Because ETS factors can cooperate with VDR to induce rat CYP24A1, we tested
      whether TMPRSS2:ETS would cause aberrant induction of human CYP24A1 limiting the 
      activity of VDR. In TMPRSS2:ETS positive VCaP cells, depletion of TMPRSS2:ETS
      substantially reduced 1,25D-mediated CYP24A1 induction. Artificial expression of 
      the type VI+72 TMPRSS2:ETS isoform in LNCaP cells synergized with 1,25D to
      greatly increase CYP24A1 expression. Thus, one of the early effects of
      TMPRSS2:ETS in prostate cells is likely a reduction in intracellular 1,25D, which
      may lead to increased proliferation. Next, we tested the net effect of VDR action
      in TMPRSS2:ETS containing PCa tumors in vivo. Unlike previous animal studies
      performed on PCa tumors lacking TMPRSS2:ETS, EB1089 (seocalcitol) (a less
      calcemic analog of 1,25D) did not inhibit the growth of TMPRSS2:ETS containing
      VCaP tumors in vivo, suggesting that the presence of TMPRSS2:ETS may limit the
      growth inhibitory actions of VDR. Our findings suggest that patients with
      TMPRSS2:ETS negative tumors may be more responsive to VDR-mediated growth
      inhibition and that TMPRSS2:ETS status should be considered in future clinical
      trials.

AB  - Skeletal lesions are a frequent complication of breast and prostate cancer and a 
      hallmark of multiple myeloma. Endocrine and paracrine factors modulate various
      aspects of bone metastases, including tumour proliferation, skeletal
      susceptibility to tumour homing, the microenvironment needed to support tumour
      persistence, and the initiation of a vicious cycle between tumour and
      bone-resident cells that further promotes tumour growth. Endocrine changes, such 
      as oestrogen or vitamin D deficiency, contribute to a fertile bone
      microenvironment that might promote bone metastases. Bone health could be
      impaired further by existing cancer treatments, especially sex hormone
      deprivation. In this Review, we discuss the effect of hormones and associated
      local factors on cross-talk between bone metabolism and tumour biology. We review
      the biology of osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions, with a focus on endocrine
      aspects, and outline potential therapeutic targets. We also summarise endocrine
      aspects of the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of bone metastases and
      provide an update on existing and future treatments.

TI  - Vitamin D, intermediary metabolism and prostate cancer tumor progression.
PG  - 183
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2014.00183 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological data have demonstrated an inverse association between serum
      vitamin D3 levels, cancer incidence and related mortality. However, the effects
      of vitamin D on prostate cancer biology and its utility for prevention of
      prostate cancer progression are not as well-defined. The data are often
      conflicting: some reports suggest that vitamin D3 induces apoptosis in androgen
      dependent prostate cancer cell lines, while others suggest that vitamin D3 only
      induces cell cycle arrest. Recent molecular studies have identified an extensive 
      synergistic crosstalk between the vitamin D- and androgen-mediated mRNA and miRNA
      expression, adding an additional layer of post-transcriptional regulation to the 
      known VDR- and AR-regulated gene activation. The Warburg effect, the inefficient 
      metabolic pathway that converts glucose to lactate for rapid energy generation,
      is a phenomenon common to many different types of cancer. This process supports
      cell proliferation and promotes cancer progression via alteration of glucose,
      glutamine and lipid metabolism. Prostate cancer is a notable exception to this
      general process since the metabolic switch that occurs early during malignancy is
      the reverse of the Warburg effect. This "anti-Warburg effect" is due to the
      unique biology of normal prostate cells that harbor a truncated TCA cycle that is
      required to produce and secret citrate. In prostate cancer cells, the TCA cycle
      activity is restored and citrate oxidation is used to produce energy for cancer
      cell proliferation. 1,25(OH)2D3 and androgen together modulates the TCA cycle via
      transcriptional regulation of zinc transporters, suggesting that 1,25(OH)2D3 and 
      androgen maintain normal prostate metabolism by blocking citrate oxidation. These
      data demonstrate the importance of androgens in the anti-proliferative effect of 
      vitamin D in prostate cancer and highlight the importance of understanding the
      crosstalk between these two signaling pathways.

TI  - Nutritional supplements and cancer: potential benefits and proven harms.
PG  - e478-86
LID - 10.14694/EdBook_AM.2014.34.e478 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional supplements are widely used among patients with cancer who perceive
      them to be anticancer and antitoxicity agents. Large-scale, randomized cancer
      prevention trials have mainly been negative, with some notable adverse and
      beneficial effects. For example, these trials showed that beta-carotene increases
      the risk of lung and stomach cancer, vitamin E increases prostate cancer and
      colorectal adenoma, and selenium reduces gastric and lung cancer in populations
      with low selenium levels but increase rates in those with higher levels. Both
      beta-carotene and vitamin E supplementation increase overall mortality. This
      article reviews phase II and III trials that examine the effects of
      multivitamins, antioxidants, vitamin D, and n-3 supplements on outcome and
      toxicity from cancer treatments. Although vitamin E and beta-carotene reduce
      toxicity from radiotherapy among patients with head and neck cancer, it has been 
      found to increase recurrence, especially among smokers. Antioxidants have mixed
      effects on chemotherapy toxicity, but there are no data on outcome. Vitamin D
      deficiency is relatively common among patients with cancer, and ongoing phase III
      trials are studying the effect of vitamin D on outcome as well as optimum vitamin
      D and calcium intakes for bone health. Docosahexanoic and eicosopentanoic acid
      supplements have mixed effects on cachexia and are currently being tested as
      potential adjuncts to maximize response to chemotherapy. Nutritional
      supplementation tailored to an individual's background diet, genetics, tumor
      histology, and treatments may yield benefits in subsets of patients. Clinicians
      should have an open dialogue with patients about nutritional supplements.
      Supplement advice needs to be individualized and come from a credible source, and
      it is best communicated by the physician.

PG  - 1465-77
LID - 10.1007/s00432-014-1706-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate and clarify the relationship between circulating
      25-hydroxyvitamin D level and prostate cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted the
      meta-analysis to better evaluate the association. Terms "25-Hydroxyvitamin
      D"/"vitamin D" and "prostate cancer" were used for literature search. RESULTS: We
      identified 21 relevant publications from databases of PubMed and MEDLINE and
      included 11,941 cases and 13,870 controls in the meta-analysis. Overall studies
      revealed a significant 17 % elevated risk of prostate cancer for individuals with
      higher level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (OR = 1.17, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.30, P = 0.004), 
      and no publication bias was found in the calculations (P = 0.629). Subgroup
      analysis confirmed the association from nested case-control study group, studies 
      from USA group and studies using serum samples group (nested case-control
      studies: OR = 1.17, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.27, P < 0.001; USA: OR = 1.15, 95 % CI =
      1.03-1.29, P = 0.017; serum: OR = 1.20, 95 % CI = 1.01-1.42, P = 0.042);
      moreover, sensitivity tests also indicated significant results in studies from
      Europe and studies conducting with plasma samples after exclusion of some
      influential single study from the analysis, respectively (Europe: OR = 1.21, 95 %
      CI = 1.04-1.40, P = 0.014; plasma: OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 1.00-1.27, P = 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis, for the first time, suggested significant
      positive relationship between high level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased
      risk of prostate cancer, reminding us that more concern should be taken into
      account during assessing the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

      eventually develop castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
      1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3/calcitriol) is a potential adjuvant therapy that
      confers antiproliferative and pro-differentiation effects in vitro, but has had
      mixed results in clinical trials. The impact of the tumor microenvironment on
      1,25D3 therapy in patients with CRPC has not been assessed. Transforming growth
      factor beta (TGFbeta), which is associated with the development of tumorigenic
      "reactive stroma" in prostate cancer, induced vitamin D3 receptor (VDR)
      expression in the human WPMY-1 prostate stromal cell line. Similarly, TGFbeta
      enhanced 1,25D3-induced upregulation of CYP24A1, which metabolizes 1,25D3 and
      thereby limits VDR activity. Ablation of Hic-5, a TGFbeta-inducible nuclear
      receptor coregulator, inhibited basal VDR expression, 1,25D3-induced CYP24A1
      expression and metabolism of 1,25D3 and TGFbeta-enhanced CYP24A1 expression. A
      Hic-5-responsive sequence was identified upstream (392-451 bp) of the CYP24A1
      transcription start site that is occupied by VDR only in the presence of Hic-5.
      Ectopic expression of Hic-5 sensitized LNCaP prostate tumor cells to
      growth-inhibitory effects of 1,25D3 independent of CYP24A1. The sensitivity of
      Hic-5-expressing LNCaP cells to 1,25D3-induced growth inhibition was accentuated 
      in coculture with Hic-5-ablated WPMY-1 cells. Therefore, these findings indicate 
      that the search for mechanisms to sensitize prostate cancer cells to the
      antiproliferative effects of VDR ligands needs to account for the impact of VDR
      activity in the tumor microenvironment. IMPLICATIONS: Hic-5 acts as a coregulator
      with distinct effects on VDR transactivation, in prostate cancer and stromal
      cells, and may exert diverse effects on adjuvant therapy designed to exploit VDR 
      activity in prostate cancer.

TI  - Prospective population-based study of the association between serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin-D levels and the incidence of specific types of cancer.
PG  - 1220-9
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested an inverse association between
      vitamin D status and cancer. We investigated the prospective associations between
      vitamin D status and the total and specific type of cancer in three cohorts from 
      the general Danish population. METHODS: A total of 12,204 individuals 18 to 71
      years old were included. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured at
      baseline, and information about cancer was obtained from the Danish Cancer
      Registry. RESULTS: During the 11.3-year median follow-up time, there were 1,248
      incident cancers. HRs [95% confidence intervals (CI)] per 10 nmol/L higher
      baseline vitamin D level were: for all cancers (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04),
      all cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, NMSC (HR = 1.00; 95% CI,
      0.97-1.03), head and neck cancer (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84-1.12), colorectal
      cancer (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.88-1.02), cancer of bronchus and lung (HR = 0.98;
      95% CI, 0.91-1.05), breast cancer (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09), cancer of the
      uterus (HR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.95-1.27), prostate cancer (HR = 1.00; 95% CI,
      0.93-1.08), cancer of the urinary organs (HR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.14), NMSC (HR
      = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), and malignant melanoma (HR = 1.06; 95% CI,
      0.95-1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Apart from a significantly higher risk for NMSC with
      higher vitamin D status, we found no statistically significant associations
      between vitamin D status and total or specific cancers. IMPACT: Our results do
      not indicate that there is an impact of vitamin D on total cancer incidence.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency predicts prostate biopsy outcomes.
PG  - 2289-99
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3085 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The association between vitamin D and prostate biopsy outcomes has not
      been evaluated. We examine serum vitamin D levels with prostate biopsy results in
      men with an abnormal prostate-specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) was obtained from 667
      men, ages 40 to 79 years, prospectively enrolled from Chicago urology clinics
      undergoing first prostate biopsy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the
      associations between 25-OH D status and incident prostate cancer, Gleason score, 
      and tumor stage. RESULTS: Among European American (EA) men, there was an
      association of 25-OH D <12 ng/mL with higher Gleason score >/= 4+4 [OR, 3.66; 95%
      confidence interval (CI), 1.41-9.50; P = 0.008] and tumor stage [stage >/= cT2b
      vs. </= cT2a, OR, 2.42 (1.14-5.10); P = 0.008]. In African American (AA) men, we 
      find increased odds of prostate cancer diagnosis on biopsy with 25-OH D < 20
      ng/mL [OR, 2.43 (1.20-4.94); P = 0.01]. AA men demonstrated an association
      between 25-OH D < 12 ng/mL and Gleason >/= 4+4 [OR, 4.89 (1.59-15.07); P =
      0.006]. There was an association with tumor stage >/= cT2b vs. </= cT2a [OR, 4.22
      (1.52-11.74); P = 0.003]. CONCLUSIONS: In AA men, vitamin D deficiency was
      associated with increased odds of prostate cancer diagnosis on biopsy. In both EA
      and AA men, severe deficiency was positively associated with higher Gleason grade
      and tumor stage.

TI  - Bone health care for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation
      therapy.
PG  - 89-102
LID - 10.3810/hp.2014.04.1107 [doi]
AB  - Patients with prostate cancer often receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as
      part of their treatment regimen. However, treatment with ADT causes multiple side
      effects, including reduced bone mineral density (BMD), lower lean body mass, and 
      a higher risk for fractures. Several organizations provide clinical practice
      guidelines for osteoporosis screening, prevention, and treatment in this
      population, but adherence to these guidelines remains low. Areas for improvement 
      in provider adherence include baseline and follow-up BMD testing, as well as
      counseling regarding healthy bone behaviors such as calcium/vitamin D intake,
      lifestyle changes, and physical exercise. Comparison of osteoporosis care in
      breast cancer and non-oncology populations shows that suboptimal bone health care
      is not isolated to prostate cancer. A summary of the literature examining
      improvements in patient adherence and provider delivery of bone health care is
      included in this review, but high-quality studies are lacking. Patients may be
      the most receptive to written educational information delivered at or near the
      time of ADT initiation. Involvement of a primary care practitioner and oncologist
      in care delivery is associated with higher BMD test use. Institution-level
      programs that automatically initiate osteoporosis screening and management may be
      effective at reducing the incidence of hip fracture. Lastly, suggestions are
      provided for future approaches to knowledge translation and quality of care
      studies to improve bone health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship and interaction of the single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KLK3 and VDR and environmental factors with
      the predisposition to prostate cancer within Chinese population. METHODS: The
      comparison between 108 patients and 242 healthy people was carried out by using
      the TaqMan/MGB Probe Technology to determine the genotypes of KLK3(rs2735839 is
      located between KLK2 and KLK3) and VDR (rs731236 is located exon 9). Univariate
      and multivariate logistic regression model were used to assess the connection of 
      genetic polymorphisms and environmental risk factors with PCa by collecting
      demographic information, as well as BMI, consumption of cigarettes, alcohol, and 
      tea, exercise, and other environmental risk factors. RESULTS: The appearing
      frequencies of AA, AG, and GG genotypes at the SNPs rs2735839 (A/G) for KLK3 were
      13.89%, 62.96% and 23.15% in PCa and 37.19%, 44.63%, 18.18% in control,
      respectively; these two groups are statistically different (P=0.00). While the
      appearing frequencies of TT, TC, and CC genotypes at the SNPs rs731236 (T/C) for 
      VDR were 88.89%, 9, 26%, 1.85% and 90.50%, 9.10%, 0.40% in control, respectively,
      with no significant statistical difference between the two group. The study
      confirmed decreasing risk in tea drinkers (OR=0.58, 95% CI=0.35-0.96).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicate that environmental factor-tea drinking is
      associated with the development of PCa. The habit of drinking tea is a protective
      factor against PCa. The SNPs rs2735839 for KLK3 is strongly related to the
      development of PCa, while the SNPs rs731236 for VDR is not. VIRTUAL SLIDES: The

AB  - BACKGROUND: In vitro, animal, and ecological studies suggest that inadequate
      vitamin D intake could increase prostate cancer risk, but results of
      biomarker-based longitudinal studies are inconsistent. METHODS: Data for this
      case (n = 1,731) and cohort (n = 3,203) analysis are from the Selenium and
      Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. Cox proportional hazard models were used to
      test whether baseline plasma vitamin D (25-hydroxy) concentration, adjusted for
      season of blood collection, was associated with the risk of total and Gleason
      score 2-6, 7-10, and 8-10 prostate cancer. RESULTS: There were U-shaped
      associations of vitamin D with total cancer risk: compared with the first
      quintile, HRs were 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-1.03; P = 0.092],
      0.74 (95% CI, 0.59-0.92; P = 0.008), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.69-1.07; P = 0.181), and
      0.98 (95% CI, 0.78-1.21; P = 0.823), for the second through fifth quintiles,
      respectively. For Gleason 7-10 cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.63 (95% CI,
      0.45-0.90; P = 0.010), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.47-0.92; P = 0.016), 0.79 (95% CI,
      0.56-1.10; P = 0.165), and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.63-1.22; P = 0.436). Among African
      American men (n = 250 cases), higher vitamin D was associated with reduced risk
      of Gleason 7-10 cancer only: in the a posteriori contrast of quintiles 1-2 versus
      3-5, the HR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = 0.037), with no evidence of
      dose-response or a U-shaped association. CONCLUSIONS: Both low and high vitamin D
      concentrations were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, and more
      strongly for high-grade disease. IMPACT: The optimal range of circulating vitamin
      D for prostate cancer prevention may be narrow. Supplementation of men with
      adequate levels may be harmful. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 23(8);

      for prostate cancer.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1002/2327-6924.12122 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies found an association between decreased 25-OH vitamin D blood
      level and prostate cancer progression. Vitamin D supplementation is controversial
      and dosage recommendations inconsistent. This study identified factors associated
      with 25-OH vitamin D levels and whether vitamin D supplementation with 800 IU/day
      raised vitamin D levels in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT). DATA SOURCES: We recruited 108 men treated with ADT
      for >/=9 months from eight cancer and urology practices. Sections of the NHANES
      2005-2006 questionnaire and Canadian Fitness Survey were completed identifying
      age, ethnicity, length of ADT use, calcium supplementation >/=1000 IU mg/day,
      body mass index, exercise, alcohol and tobacco use, and vitamin D supplementation
      >/=800 IU/daily. Blood was collected for 25-OH vitamin D analysis. CONCLUSIONS:
      The majority of men (66%) had blood levels of 25-OH vitamin D <32 ng/mL.
      Regression analysis showed vitamin D supplementation (beta = 6.556, CI 1.463,
      11.650; p = .012) and African American ethnicity (beta = -7.816, CI -12.996,
      -2.635; p = .003) is associated with 25-OH vitamin D level after controlling age 
      and tobacco use. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Findings support current recommendations 
      for supplementation with >/=800 IU vitamin D/day for men receiving ADT. Nurse
      practitioners caring for prostate cancer patients receiving ADT should include
      vitamin D monitoring and supplementation.

TI  - The role of vitamin D in reducing cancer risk and progression.
PG  - 342-57
LID - 10.1038/nrc3691 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D is not really a vitamin but the precursor to the potent steroid hormone
      calcitriol, which has widespread actions throughout the body. Calcitriol
      regulates numerous cellular pathways that could have a role in determining cancer
      risk and prognosis. Although epidemiological and early clinical trials are
      inconsistent, and randomized control trials in humans do not yet exist to
      conclusively support a beneficial role for vitamin D, accumulating results from
      preclinical and some clinical studies strongly suggest that vitamin D deficiency 
      increases the risk of developing cancer and that avoiding deficiency and adding
      vitamin D supplements might be an economical and safe way to reduce cancer
      incidence and improve cancer prognosis and outcome.

TI  - The impact of bone mineral density testing, fracture assessment, and osteoporosis
      education in men treated by androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 2409-15
LID - 10.1007/s00520-014-2183-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer have low 
      knowledge of osteoporosis (OP) and engage in few healthy bone behaviors (HBBs). A
      multicomponent intervention was piloted in this population. Changes in OP
      knowledge, self-efficacy, health beliefs, and engagement in HBBs were evaluated. 
      METHODS: A pre-post pilot study was performed in a convenience sample of men
      recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Men were sent personalized
      letters explaining their dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results and fracture
      risk assessment with an OP-related education booklet. Participants completed
      questionnaires assessing OP knowledge, self-efficacy, health beliefs, and current
      engagement in HBBs at baseline (T1) and 3 months post-intervention (T2). Paired t
      tests and McNemar's test were used to assess changes in outcomes. RESULTS: A
      total of 148 men completed the study. There was an increase in OP knowledge (9.7 
      +/- 4.3 to 11.4 +/- 3.3, p < 0.0001) and feelings of susceptibility (16.5 +/- 4.3
      to 17.4 +/- 4.7, p = 0.015), but a decrease in total self-efficacy (86.3 +/- 22.9
      to 81.0 +/- 27.6, p = 0.007) from baseline to post-intervention. Men made
      appropriate changes in their overall daily calcium intake (p </= 0.001), and
      there was uptake of vitamin D supplementation from 44 % (n = 65) to 68 % (n = 99)
      (p < 0.0001). Men with bone loss (osteopenia or OP) had a greater change in
      susceptibility (1.9 +/- 4.3 vs. -0.22 +/- 4.2, p = 0.005) compared to men with
      normal bone density. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence that a
      multicomponent intervention such as the one described can lead to increased
      knowledge and feelings of susceptibility regarding OP and can enhance uptake of
      some HBBs.

TI  - Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels in men undergoing radical
      prostatectomy: is there an association with adverse pathologic features?

AB  - INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence
      of vitamin D (VitD) deficiency in men undergoing radical prostatectomy and
      determine whether an association exists between preoperative VitD levels and
      adverse pathologic features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients scheduled to undergo 
      radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease from January to August
      2012 were prospectively followed and those with available preoperative serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were included. Men with a known diagnosis of VitD
      deficiency or taking VitD supplementation were excluded. Cox regression analysis 
      was performed to determine whether preoperative VitD level is predictive of
      adverse pathologic outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred consecutive men were included. 
      Mean age was 62 (range, 42-79) years and mean VitD level was 26 (range, 6-57)
      ng/mL. Overall, 65 men (65%) had suboptimal levels of VitD (< 30 ng/mL), and 32
      (32%) had deficiency (< 20 ng/mL). There was no significant correlation between
      VitD and age (P = .5). In logistic regression analysis, VitD level was not
      predictive of pathologic Gleason (P = .11), pathologic stage (P = .7), or
      positive margin status (P = .8). CONCLUSION: The association between VitD and
      prostate cancer has been controversial and data suggesting an increased risk of
      aggressive cancer in men with low levels of VitD have been inconsistent. We found
      that baseline preoperative VitD level was not associated with any adverse
      pathologic features. However, VitD deficiency is a common finding in this
      population, although unrelated to patient age. These results represent the first 
      time the correlation between VitD and prostate cancer has been evaluated in a
      cohort of men undergoing radical prostatectomy.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of bone loss in patients with nonmetastatic breast or
      prostate cancer who receive hormonal ablation therapy.
PG  - 223-30
LID - 10.1188/14.CJON.223-230 [doi]
AB  - Hormone ablation therapy is a mainstay in the treatment of breast and prostate
      cancers. However, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) used in postmenopausal women with
      breast cancer and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) used in men with prostate
      cancer contribute to substantial bone loss, thereby increasing the risk of
      osteoporotic fractures. Evidence-based guidelines, therefore, urge oncology
      practices to screen these patients for bone loss and, if needed, provide
      treatment to maintain bone health. In addition to lifestyle modification and
      calcium or vitamin D supplementation, bone protection strategies include
      treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANK 
      ligand. Identification of patients at greater risk for bone loss and fracture and
      proper interventions can reduce fracture rates. Oncology nurses can play an
      important role in screening these patients. The purpose of this article is to
      inform oncology nurses about the effects of cancer treatment on bone health,
      review current prevention and treatment options for cancer treatment-induced bone
      loss, and discuss recommendations for identifying high-risk individuals.

TI  - Recurrence season impacts the survival of epithelial ovarian cancer patients.
PG  - 1627-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies indicated that the diagnosis season affects the
      prognosis of some cancers, such as examples in the prostate, colon and breast
      This retrospective study aimed to investigate whether the diagnosis and recurrent
      season impacts the prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: From
      January 2005 to August 2010, 161 epithelial ovarian cancer patients were analyzed
      and followed up until August 2013. Kaplan- Meier survival curves and the log-rank
      test were used to make the survival analysis. Multivariate analysis was conducted
      to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: The prognostic factors of
      overall survival in epithelial ovarian cancer patients included age, clinical
      stage, pathological type, histological grade, residual disease after primary
      surgery, recurrent season and adjuvant chemotherapy cycles. Moreover, clinical
      stage, histological grade, residual disease after primary surgery, recurrent
      season and adjuvant chemotherapy cycles also impacted the progression-free
      survival of epithelial ovarian cancer patients. The diagnosis season did not have
      a significantly relationship with the survival of operable epithelial ovarian
      cancer patients. Median overall survival of patients with recurrent month from
      April to November was 47 months, which was longer (P < 0.001) than that of
      patients with recurrence month from December to March (19 months). Median
      progression-free survival of patients with recurrence month from April to
      November and December to March was 20 and 8 months, respectively (P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: The recurrence season impacts the survival of epithelial ovarian
      cancer patients. However, the diagnosed season does not appear to exert a
      significant influence.

TI  - Filaggrin loss-of-function mutations and incident cancer: a population-based
      study.
PG  - 1407-14
LID - 10.1111/bjd.12969 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) could have
      opposing effects on cancer risk, as mutations are associated with both 10% higher
      serum vitamin D levels, which may protect against cancer, and with impaired skin 
      barrier function, which may lead to higher cancer susceptibility. OBJECTIVES: To 
      investigate the association of the FLG genotype and cancer types in four
      population-based cohorts. METHODS: A total of 13,376 individuals were genotyped
      for FLG mutations. Information on cancer was obtained from the Danish Cancer
      Registry. Persons with a history of cancer at baseline were excluded from
      prospective analyses. RESULTS: There were 1339 incident cancers (median follow-up
      11.4 years). The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for FLG
      mutation carriers vs. wild types were: for any cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI
      0.78-1.16), any cancer excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (HR 1.05, 95% CI 
      0.84-1.31), head and neck cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 0.71-4.15), colorectal cancer
      (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44-1.52), bronchus and lung cancer (HR 1.34, 95% CI
      0.77-2.33), breast cancer (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.30-1.14), uterine cancer (HR 0.42,
      95% CI 0.06-3.10), prostate cancer (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.61-1.94), urinary cancer
      (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.51-3.29), malignant melanoma (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.41-2.58) and
      NMSC (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.47-1.05). Among participants aged over 60 years at
      baseline, we found statistically significant lower risks of all cancers and NMSC 
      among FLG mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The only significant associations
      between FLG loss-of-function mutations and cancer were in subgroup analyses.

TI  - Early growth inhibition is followed by increased metastatic disease with vitamin 
      D (calcitriol) treatment in the TRAMP model of prostate cancer.
PG  - e89555
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0089555 [doi]
AB  - The active metabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) has
      antiproliferative effects in non-aggressive prostate cancer, however, its effects
      in more aggressive model systems are still unclear. In these studies, effects of 
      calcitriol and a less-calcemic vitamin D analog, QW-1624F2-2 (QW), were tested in
      vivo, using the aggressive autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse
      prostate (TRAMP) model. To study prevention of androgen-stimulated prostate
      cancer, vehicle, calcitriol (20 microg/kg), or QW (50 microg/kg) were
      administered to 4 week-old TRAMP mice intraperitoneal (i.p.) 3x/week on a MWF
      schedule for 14 weeks. Calcitriol and QW slowed progression of prostate cancer as
      indicated by reduced urogenital tract (p = 0.0022, calcitriol; p = 0.0009, QW)
      and prostate weights (p = 0.0178, calcitriol; p = 0.0086, QW). However, only
      calcitriol increased expression of the pro-differentiation marker, cadherin 1 (p 
      = 0.0086), and reduced tumor proliferation (p = 0.0467). By contrast, neither
      vitamin D analog had any effect on castration resistant prostate cancer in mice
      treated pre- or post-castration. Interestingly, although vitamin D showed
      inhibitory activity against primary tumors in hormone-intact mice, distant organ 
      metastases seemed to be enhanced following treatment (p = 0.0823). Therefore,
      TRAMP mice were treated long-term with calcitriol to further examine effects on
      metastasis. Calcitriol significantly increased the number of distant organ
      metastases when mice were treated from 4 weeks-of-age until development of
      palpable tumors (20-25 weeks-of-age)(p = 0.0003). Overall, data suggest that
      early intervention with vitamin D in TRAMP slowed androgen-stimulated tumor
      progression, but prolonged treatment resulted in development of a resistant and
      more aggressive disease associated with increased distant organ metastasis.

      D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is now understood to be a mitogen for prostate
      cancer cells, and calcium has already been known for such role. The interplay
      between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system effector hormones and calcium
      homeostasis attracts attention in recent studies. METHODS: Twenty five patients
      with prostate cancer (median age 66 (62-67) years) who had presented at the
      Urology Outpatient Clinic were prospectively included in the study. Also, 30
      volunteer controls (median age 63 (60-70) years) were enrolled for comparison.
      Serum total PSA, intact PTH, calcium, aldosterone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels
      were detected in a selected group of patients with prostate cancer. RESULTS: The 
      vitamin D levels were lower in PCa patients in line with some of the previous
      studies, supporting the role of vitamin D in prostate cancer. We also observed a 
      positive correlation between PTH and PSA both in PCa patients and the controls.
      CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that like age and race, PSA is associated with 
      PTH. The role of PTH, as a master of calcium homeostasis, seems to be neglected
      in prostate carcinogenesis, concerning a very few number of studies pertaining to
      the subject in the literature (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 19).

TI  - Osteoporosis and prostate cancer: a cross-sectional study of Danish men with
      prostate cancer before androgen deprivation therapy.
PG  - 350-5
LID - 10.3109/21681805.2014.884160 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of osteoporosis
      and risk factors of osteoporotic fractures before androgen deprivation in Danish 
      men. Treatment and prognosis of prostate cancer necessitate management of
      long-term consequences of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including
      accelerated bone loss resulting in osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures are
      associated with excess morbidity and mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients
      with prostate cancer awaiting initiation of ADT were consecutively included. Half
      of the patients had localized disease and were referred for curative intended
      radiation, and the remaining patients had disseminated disease. Blood samples
      were collected, a questionnaire was administered and a dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed before initiating ADT. The patients were 
      included between January 2010 and March 2012. The study was approved by the local
      ethics committee. None of the patients had received prior androgen deprivation or
      osteoporosis treatment. RESULTS: In total, 105 individuals were included. The
      mean age of the participants was 70 years (range 53-91 years, SD 6.3). The median
      prostate-specific antigen level was 30.5 g/l (1-5714 g/l). The average Gleason
      score was 7.8 (range 5-10, SD 1.1). Fifty patients had localized prostate cancer 
      and the other 55 patients had disseminated disease. The prevalence of
      osteoporosis was 10% and the prevalence of osteopenia was 58% before ADT. There
      was no significant difference between the two subgroups concerning osteoporosis. 
      Smoking use was the only factor that was significantly associated with an
      increased prevalence of osteoporosis in the study population. CONCLUSION:
      Two-thirds of patients with prostate cancer awaiting ADT had osteoporosis or
      reduced bone mass. Further awareness regarding osteoporosis and bone health in
      prostate cancer is needed. It is suggested that patients with prostate cancer
      undergo a DXA scan before starting ADT.

TI  - Potent antiproliferative effects of 25-hydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-vitamin D(3) that
      resists the catalytic activity of both CYP27B1 and CYP24A1.
PG  - 1392-402
LID - 10.1002/jcb.24789 [doi]
AB  - The potency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) is increased by several fold
      through its metabolism into 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3) by
      cytochrome P450 27B1 (CYP27B1). Thus, the pivotal role of 1alpha-hydroxylation in
      the activation of vitamin D compounds is well known. Here, we examined the
      metabolism of 25-hydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-vitamin D3 (25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3), a
      synthetic analog of 25(OH)D3 in a cell-free system and demonstrated that
      25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 is neither activated by CYP27B1 nor inactivated by
      cytochrome P450 24A1 (CYP24A1). These findings were also confirmed in
      immortalized normal human prostate epithelial cells (PZ-HPV-7) which are known to
      express both CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, indicating that the structural modifications
      featured in 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 enable the analog to resist the actions of
      both CYP27B1 and CYP24A1. To provide intelligible structure-function information,
      we also performed molecular docking analysis between the analog and CYP27B1.
      Furthermore, 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 was found to suppress the growth of PZ-HPV-7
      cells with a potency equivalent to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. The antiproliferative
      activity of 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3 was found to be vitamin D receptor
      (VDR)-dependent as it failed to inhibit the growth of mammary tumor cells derived
      from VDR-knockout mice. Furthermore, stable introduction of VDR into VDR-knockout
      cells restored the growth inhibition by 25(OH)-16-ene-23-yne-D3. Thus, we
      identified 25-hydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-vitamin D3 as a novel non-1alpha-hydroxylated
      vitamin D analog which is equipotent to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 in its antiproliferative
      activity. We now propose that the low potency of the intrinsic VDR-mediated
      activities of 25(OH)D3 can be augmented to the level of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 without 
      its activation through 1alpha-hydroxylation by CYP27B1, but by simply preventing 
      its inactivation by CYP24A1.

AB  - Nutritional factors may influence the risk of developing prostate cancer, but
      understanding of this topic is poor. This chapter discusses research on this
      subject, mostly from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
      Nutrition (EPIC), a cohort which includes 150,000 men recruited in the 1990s in
      eight European countries. So far the EPIC collaborators have published analyses
      of the relationship of prostate cancer risk with the intake of a range of foods
      and nutrients, and with blood-based markers of nutritional factors, on up to
      nearly 3,000 incident cases of prostate cancer. Most of the results of these
      analyses have been null, with no clear indication that the risk for prostate
      cancer is related to intakes of meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, fibre, fat or
      alcohol or with blood levels of fatty acids, carotenoids, tocopherols, B
      vitamins, vitamin D, or selenium. There is some evidence from EPIC that risk may 
      be increased in men with a high intake of protein from dairy products, and
      analyses of hormone levels have shown that risk is higher in men with relatively 
      high blood levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). More research is
      needed to better describe the relationships of prostate cancer risk with IGF-I
      and related hormones, and to better understand whether nutritional factors may
      influence risk through hormones or perhaps by other mechanisms.

TI  - LncRNA: a new player in 1alpha, 25(OH)(2) vitamin D(3) /VDR protection against
      skin cancer formation.
PG  - 147-50
LID - 10.1111/exd.12341 [doi]
AB  - Sunlight, vitamin D and skin cancer form a controversial brew. While too much
      sunlight exposure causes skin cancer, it is the major source of vitamin D from
      skin. We propose that these processes can be balanced. Vitamin D signalling (VDS)
      protects against skin cancer as demonstrated by the susceptibility of the skin to
      tumor formation in VDR null mice and protection from UVB-induced mutations when
      VDR agonists are administered. The question is how is protection afforded.
      Previously, we have focused on the Wnt/beta-catenin/hedgehog and DNA damage
      repair (DDR) pathways. As VDR regulates hundreds of genes with thousands of VDR
      response elements (VDRE) throughout the genome, and many VDREs are in non-coding 
      regions, we decided to explore long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA). LncRNAs are
      mRNA-like transcripts ranging from 200 bases ~100 kb lacking significant open
      reading frames. They are aberrantly expressed in human cancers and involved in a 
      spectrum of tumorigenic/metastatic processes (cell
      proliferation/apoptosis/angiogenesis). We discovered that VDS regulated the
      expression of certain lncRNAs in a manner consistent with VDS protection against 
      skin cancer. Given the huge variation in genes actively regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D 
      from different cell types, it is conceivable that our results could apply to
      personalized medicine based on the distinctive lncRNA profiles. These lncRNAs
      could also serve as skin cancer biomarkers secreted into the blood or urine via
      exosomes as demonstrated in other cancer types (breast, prostate). Modulation of 
      lncRNA profile by VDS may also provide insight into regulating pathways such as
      Wnt/ss-catenin and hedgehog.

TI  - Genetic variants in the CYP24A1 gene are associated with prostate cancer risk and
      aggressiveness in a Korean study population.
PG  - 149-56
LID - 10.1038/pcan.2014.1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D-deactivating enzyme CYP24A1 had controversial effects on
      prostate cancer risk; the genetic study also showed the controversial results.
      Therefore, we identified the relationships between polymorphisms in CYP24A1 and
      prostate cancer in a Korean cohort. METHODS: We evaluated the association between
      21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 and prostate cancer in
      Korean men (272 prostate cancers and 173 controls). BPH patients with high PSA or
      abnormal digital rectal examination who underwent negative prostate biopsy were
      enrolled in the control group. Twenty-one SNPs in the CYP24A1 were selected from 
      the International HapMap database and the NCBI database with calculation of minor
      allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium, preferably including the SNPs that
      were nonsynonymous and located within exons. We also investigated the association
      between 21 SNPs in the CYP24A1 gene and known clinical characteristics, such as
      the PSA level, clinical stage, pathological stage and Gleason score. RESULTS: The
      statistical analysis suggested that five CYP24A1 sequence variants
      (rs2248461-odds ratio (OR): 0.63, rs2248359-OR: 0.65, rs6022999-OR: 0.65,
      rs2585428-OR: 0.46, rs4809959-OR: 0.52) had a significant association with
      prostate cancer risk after multiple comparisons by a method of false discovery
      rate. Logistic analyses of the CYP24A1 polymorphisms with several prostate
      cancer-related factors showed that several SNPs were significant: four SNPs to
      PSA level, three to clinical stage, two to pathological stage and two SNPs to the
      Gleason score. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that some CYP24A1
      gene polymorphisms might be associated with the risk of prostate cancer in Korean
      men. Five CYP24A1 sequence variants showed the significance to predict prostate
      cancer, and several SNPs of CYP24A1 gene had an important finding to predict
      prostate cancer-related factors. However, these results should be validated in
      future large-scale studies.

AB  - The beneficial effects of vitamin D3 are exerted through
      1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3], the dihydroxy metabolite of
      vitamin D3. Hepatic and intestinal biotransformation of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and
      modifiers of metabolic capacity could be important determinants of
      bioavailability in serum and tissues. Ginsenosides and their aglycones, mainly
      20(S)-protopanaxadiol (aPPD) and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (aPPT), are routinely
      ingested as health supplements. The purpose of the present study was to
      investigate the potential of ginsenosides and their aglycones to block hepatic
      and intestinal inactivation of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, which is the most potent ligand 
      of vitamin D receptor. In vitro biotransformation reactions were initiated with
      NADPH regenerating solutions following initial preincubation of pooled human
      hepatic or intestinal microsomal protein or human recombinant CYP3A4 supersomes
      with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or midazolam. Formation of hydroxylated metabolites of
      1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or midazolam was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. Co-incubation of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 with various ginsenosides (Rg1,
      Rh2, aPPD, aPPT and total ginsenosides) led to differential inhibition (30-100%) 
      of its hydroxylation. Results suggest that aPPD, aPPT and Rh2 strongly attenuated
      the hydroxylation of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. Follow up inhibition studies with aPPD and
      aPPT at varying concentrations (0.5-100muM) led to up to 91-100% inhibition of
      formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 thus preventing
      inactivation of active vitamin D3. The IC50 values of aPPD or aPPT for the most
      abundant hydroxylated metabolites of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 ranged from 3.3 to 9.0muM
      in human microsomes. The inhibitory mechanism of aPPD or aPPT for CYP3A4-mediated
      biotransformation of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 was competitive in nature (apparent Ki:
      1.7-2.9muM). Similar inhibitory effects were also observed upon addition of aPPD 
      or aPPT into midazolam hydroxylation assay. In summary, our results suggest that 
      ginsenosides, specifically aPPD and aPPT, inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated catabolism 
      of active vitamin D3 in human liver and intestine, potentially providing
      additional vitamin D-related benefits to patients with cancer, neurodegenerative 
      and metabolic diseases.

AB  - CONTEXT: Vitamin D3 might benefit prostate cancer (PCa) patients because prostate
      cells can locally synthesize the active hormone calcitriol. OBJECTIVE: Our
      objective was to determine the effects of oral vitamin D3 on vitamin D
      metabolites and PCa proliferative activity in prostate tissue. DESIGN AND
      SETTING: We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical
      oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada. PATIENTS: PCa patients (Gleason 6 or 7)
      participated in the study. Of 66 subjects who were enrolled, 63 completed the
      dosing protocol. INTERVENTION: Vitamin D3 (400, 10000, or 40000 IU/d) was orally 
      administered before radical prostatectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated
      vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in surgical prostate tissue. Safety
      measures, PTH, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also assessed. RESULTS:
      Prostate tissue and serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, including calcitriol, 
      increased dose dependently (P<.03) and were significantly higher in the
      40000-IU/d group than in every other dose group (P<.03). Prostate vitamin D
      metabolites correlated positively with serum levels (P<.0001). Ki67 measures did 
      not differ significantly among vitamin D dose groups. However, cross-sectional
      analysis indicated that the calcitriol level attained in prostate was inversely
      associated with Ki67 intensity and Ki67 (3+) percent positive nuclei in PCa and
      benign tissue (P<.05). Safety measures did not change adversely with dosing.
      Compared with the 400-IU/d group, serum PTH and PSA were lower in the combined
      higher-dose groups at the end of the study (P< .02). CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin D3
      raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both
      PSA and PTH. Although Ki67 expression did not differ among dose groups, its
      levels correlated inversely with prostate calcitriol. These suggestions of
      clinical benefit justify continued clinical research.

AB  - The vitamin D receptor (VDR) can influence cancer susceptibility through binding 
      to vitamin D. However, the previous studies were contradictory. Therefore this
      meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the association between VDR polymorphisms 
      (BsmI, TaqI, FokI, and ApaI) and cancer risk. One hundred twenty-six studies were
      enrolled through PubMed. For VDR BsmI polymorphism, significantly increased
      cancer risks were observed in the overall analysis. In the further stratified
      analysis, increased risks were observed in colorectal and skin cancer, especially
      in Caucasian population. However, no significant associations were observed in
      other VDR polymorphisms in the overall analysis. In the further subgroup
      analysis, increased risks were found in oral, breast, and basal cell cancer while
      decreased risk was found in prostate cancer in t allele carriers of TaqI
      polymorphism. For VDR FokI polymorphism, increased risks were found in ovarian
      and skin cancer while decreased risk in glioma in f allele carriers. For VDR ApaI
      polymorphism, increased risk was observed in basal cell cancer, especially in
      Asian population in a allele carriers. In conclusion, these results indicated
      that b allele of BamI polymorphism was a risk factor for cancer susceptibility.
      Meanwhile, t allele of TaqI polymorphism was a risk factor for oral, breast, and 
      basal cell cancer and a protective factor for prostate cancer. Moreover, f allele
      of FokI polymorphism was a risk factor for ovarian and skin cancer and a
      protective factor for glioma. Finally, a allele of ApaI polymorphism was a risk
      factor for basal cell cancer in Asian population.

AB  - Prostate cancer remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among the male 
      population worldwide. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to prostate cancer and
      its aggressiveness. Herein, we initiated a retrospective study to evaluate
      vitamin D status and monitoring in veterans with prostate cancer, and to examine 
      the potential link between vitamin D and survival status and length of survival
      in this population. We found that veterans who were initially vitamin D deficient
      were significantly less likely to survive than those who were not initially
      deficient, and that both initial and follow-up vitamin D deficiency were
      associated with decreased likelihood of survival after prostate cancer diagnosis.
      We recommend that vitamin D deficiency be replaced in veterans with prostate
      cancer.

AB  - The negative association of the latitude where people live and the incidence of
      non cutaneous cancer in that population in North America have been demonstrated
      in many studies for many types of cancer. Since the intensity of UVB exposure
      decreases with increasing latitude, and UVB exposure provides the mechanism for
      vitamin D production in the skin, the hypothesis that increased vitamin D
      provides protection against the development of cancer has been proposed. This
      hypothesis has been tested in a substantial number of prospective and case
      control studies and in a few randomized clinical trials (RTC) assessing whether
      either vitamin D intake or serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) correlate 
      (inversely) with cancer development. Most of the studies have focused on
      colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. The results have been mixed. The most
      compelling data for a beneficial relationship between vitamin D intake or serum
      25OHD levels and cancer have been obtained for colorectal cancer. The bulk of the
      evidence also favors a beneficial relationship for breast cancer, but the benefit
      of vitamin D for prostate and skin cancer in clinical populations has been
      difficult to demonstrate. RTCs in general have been flawed in execution or too
      small to provide compelling evidence one way or the other. In contrast, animal
      studies have been quite consistent in their demonstration that vitamin D and/or
      its active metabolite 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) can prevent the
      development and/or treat a variety of cancers in a variety of animal models.
      Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D has been shown to impact a number of cellular mechanisms 
      that would be expected to underlie its anticancer effects. Thus, there is a
      dilemma-animal and cellular studies strongly support a role for vitamin D in the 
      prevention and treatment of cancer, but the clinical studies for most cancers
      have not yet delivered compelling evidence that the promise from preclinical
      studies has been fulfilled in the clinic.

TI  - PT19c, Another Nonhypercalcemic Vitamin D2 Derivative, Demonstrates Antitumor
      Efficacy in Epithelial Ovarian and Endometrial Cancer Models.
PG  - 524-34

AB  - Hypercalcemia remains a major impediment to the clinical use of vitamin D in
      cancer treatment. Approaches to remove hypercalcemia and development of
      nonhypercalcemic agents can lead to the development of vitamin D-based therapies 
      for treatment of various cancers. In this report, in vitro and in vivo anticancer
      efficacy, safety, and details of vitamin D receptor (VDR) interactions of PT19c, 
      a novel nonhypercalcemic vitamin D derived anticancer agent, are described. PT19c
      was synthesized by bromoacetylation of PTAD-ergocalciferol adduct. Broader growth
      inhibitory potential of PT19c was evaluated in a panel of chemoresistant breast, 
      renal, ovarian, lung, colon, leukemia, prostate, melanoma, and central nervous
      system cancers cell line types of NCI60 cell line panel. Interactions of PT19c
      with VDR were determined by a VDR transactivation assay in a VDR overexpressing
      VDR-UAS-bla-HEK293 cells, in vitro VDR-coregulator binding, and molecular docking
      with VDR-ligand binding domain (VDR-LBD) in comparison with calcitriol. Acute
      toxicity of PT19c was determined in nontumored mice. In vivo antitumor efficacy
      of PT19c was determined via ovarian and endometrial cancer xenograft experiments.
      Effect of PT19c on actin filament organization and focal adhesion formation was
      examined by microscopy. PT19c treatment inhibited growth of chemoresistant NCI60 
      cell lines (log10GI50 ~ -4.05 to -6.73). PT19c (10 mg/kg, 35 days) reduced growth
      of ovarian and endometrial xenograft tumor without hypercalcemia. PT19c exerted
      no acute toxicity up to 400 mg/kg (QDx1) in animals. PT19c showed weak VDR
      antagonism, lack of VDR binding, and inverted spatial accommodation in VDR-LBD.
      PT19c caused actin filament dysfunction and inhibited focal adhesion in SKOV-3
      cells. PT19c is a VDR independent nonhypercalcemic vitamin D-derived agent that
      showed noteworthy safety and efficacy in ovarian and endometrial cancer animal
      models and inhibited actin organization and focal adhesion in ovarian cancer
      cells.

TI  - The Di Bella Method (DBM) in the treatment of prostate cancer: a preliminary
      retrospective study of 16 patients and a review of the literature.
PG  - 523-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the objective clinical response and the safety of the
      combined administration of somatostatin, melatonin, retinoids, vitamin D3,
      dopamine subtype 2 receptor (D2R) agonists and low doses of cyclophosphamide,
      associated with androgen ablation, in patients with a histological diagnosis of
      prostate adenocarcinoma (Pac). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 30
      patients with non-invasive and metastatic prostate cancer, who attended our
      institution over a period of more than 5 years, were retrospectively reviewed.
      RESULTS: 16 patients satisfied the evaluation criteria. Median age: 64 years.
      Disease stages: 8 patients (50%) were in Stage II. For advanced stages (Stage
      IV), secondary lesions were located in the bones and lymph nodes. Taken together,
      an overall objective response (OR) [Complete response (CR) + Partial Response
      (PR)] was achieved in 69% of the patients, with 88% of objective clinical benefit
      [CR+PR+SD]. For local Prostate Cancer group, an OR was achieved in 87.5% of
      patients (7 cases; 53-98; 95% CI), with CR in 62.5% (5 cases, 31-86; 95% CI). In 
      metastatic disease, the OR was 50% (4 cases; 21-78; 95% CI), with a 20% of CR (2 
      cases; 7-59; 95% CI) and 75% of clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary
      study shows that patients with early and advanced forms of prostate cancer, not
      previously treated by surgery and/or chemo-radiotherapy, can achieve a more than 
      positive clinical benefit with the protocol foreseen by the Di Bella Method.
      Further clinical investigations are strongly recommended.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor and the risk of prostate cancer: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 961-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms are considered to be risk factors
      for prostate cancer. However, previous case-control studies on the association
      between the variants of VDR and prostate cancer have shown contradictory results.
      Therefore, the role of VDR in prostate cancer remains unresolved. To investigate 
      a potential correlation between VDR polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk, a
      meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies was conducted. METHODS: Eligible
      studies were retrieved via both computerized searches and review of references.
      The association of VDR polymorphisms to prostate cancer was evaluated for 4
      well-known VDR polymorphisms (FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI) separately. Stratified
      analyses on ethnic characteristics (Caucasians or Asians), cancer stage
      (localized or advanced) and Gleason score (<7 or >>7) were performed. Fixed- or
      random-effect models were used to summarize the estimates of odds ratio (OR) with
      95%CI according to the heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted.
      RESULTS: A total of 40 studies met the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis.
      The FF genotype illustrated a protective effect on prostate cancer in the
      Caucasian subgroup (OR=0.905, 95%CI 0.823, 0.995). Conversely, the bb and the TT 
      genotypes were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=0.838, 95%CI
      0.709,0.990; OR=1.127, 95%CI 1.023,1.242, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our analysis
      supported the hypothesis that several different VDR polymorphisms may increase
      the risk of prostate cancer. However, others illustrated a protective effect on
      carcinogenesis. Further efforts should be made to establish the mechanisms
      between VDR polymorphisms and prostate cancer.

BTI - Vitamin, Mineral, and Multivitamin Supplements for the Primary Prevention of
      Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S.
      Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - In the United States, dietary supplements are commonly used to prevent chronic
      diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. To systematically
      review evidence for the use of multivitamins or single nutrients and functionally
      related nutrient pairs for the prevention of CVD and cancer in the general
      population (primary prevention). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database
      of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify literature that was
      published between 2005 and January 29, 2013. We also examined the references from
      the previous reviews and other relevant reviews to identify additional studies;
      we also searched Web sites of government agencies and other organizations for
      grey literature. Two investigators independently reviewed identified abstracts
      and full-text articles against a set of a priori inclusion and quality criteria. 
      One investigator abstracted data into an evidence table and a second investigator
      checked these data. We qualitatively and quantitatively synthesized the results
      for the four key questions and grouped the included studies by study supplement. 
      We conducted meta-analyses using Mantel-Haenzel fixed effects models for overall 
      cancer incidence, CVD incidence, and all-cause mortality. We included 103
      articles representing 26 unique studies. Very few studies examined the use of
      multivitamin supplements. Two trials showed a protective effect against cancer in
      men; only one of these trials included women and found no effect. No effects of
      treatment were seen on CVD or all-cause mortality. Beta-carotene showed a
      negative effect on lung cancer incidence and mortality among individuals at high 
      risk for lung cancer at baseline (i.e., smokers and asbestos-exposed workers);
      this effect was persistent even when combined with vitamin A or E. Trials of
      vitamin E supplementation showed mixed results and altogether had no overall
      effect on cancer, CVD, or all-cause mortality. Only one of two included selenium 
      trials showed a beneficial effect for colorectal and prostate cancer; however,
      this trial included a small sample size. The few studies addressing folic acid,
      vitamin C, and vitamin A showed no effect on CVD, cancer, and mortality. Vitamin 
      D and/or calcium supplementation also showed no overall effect on CVD, cancer,
      and mortality. Harms were infrequently reported and aside from limited
      paradoxical effects for some supplements, were not considered serious. There are 
      a limited number of trials examining the effects of dietary supplements on the
      primary prevention of CVD and cancer; the majority showed no effect in healthy
      populations. Clinical heterogeneity of included studies limits generalizability
      of results to the general primary care population. Results from trials in at-risk
      populations discourage additional studies for particular supplements (e.g.,
      beta-carotene); however, future research in general primary care populations and 
      on other supplements is required to address research gaps.

TI  - Abiraterone inhibits 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism by CYP3A4 in human 
      liver and intestine in vitro.
PG  - 50-8

AB  - The chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of vitamin D3 are exerted through its
      dihydroxylated metabolite, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3].
      Inactivation of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) may be an
      important determinant of its serum and tissue levels. Abiraterone, a
      steroidogenesis inhibitor used in late stage prostate cancer treatment, is a
      CYP17A1 inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of
      abiraterone to block hepatic and intestinal inactivation of biologically active
      vitamin D3in vitro and to evaluate if abiraterone can alter CYP3A4 marker
      substrate activities. Biotransformation reactions were initiated with NADPH
      regenerating solutions following initial preincubation of pooled human hepatic or
      intestinal microsomal protein or human recombinant CYP3A4 supersomes with
      1alpha,25(OH)2D3, midazolam or triazolam for 10min at 37 degrees C. Formation of 
      hydroxylated metabolites of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, midazolam or triazolam was analyzed
      by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Co-incubation of
      1alpha,25(OH)2D3 with abiraterone at varying concentrations (0.2-100muM) led to
      up to approximately 85% inhibition of formation of hydroxylated metabolites of
      1alpha,25(OH)2D3 thus preventing inactivation of active vitamin D3. The IC50
      values for individual metabolites of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 ranged from 0.4 to 2.2muM
      in human liver microsomes or human intestinal microsomes. The mechanism of
      CYP3A4-mediated inhibition of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 by abiraterone was competitive
      (apparent Ki 2.8-4.3muM). Similar inhibitory effects were also observed upon
      inclusion of abiraterone into midazolam or triazolam hydroxylation assays. In
      summary, our results suggest that abiraterone inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated
      inactivation of active vitamin D3 in human liver and intestine, potentially
      providing additional anti-cancer benefits to prostate cancer patients. This
      article is part of a Special Issue entitled '16th Vitamin D Workshop'.

AB  - The importance of vitamin D in maintaining skeletal health via the regulation of 
      calcium has long been recognized as a critical function of this secosteroid. An
      abundance of literature shows an association between oral bone mineral density
      and some measure of systemic osteoporosis and suggests that osteoporosis/low bone
      mass may be a risk factor for periodontal disease. Recently, nonskeletal
      functions of vitamin D have gained notoriety for several reasons. Many cells that
      are not associated with calcium homeostasis have been demonstrated to possess
      membrane receptors for vitamin D. These include activated T and B lymphocytes,
      and skin, placenta, pancreas, prostate and colon cancer cells. In addition,
      vitamin D "insufficiency" is a worldwide epidemic and epidemiologic evidence has 
      linked this condition to multiple chronic health problems, including
      cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, hypertension and a variety of cancers.
      Interestingly, there is mounting evidence connecting diminished serum levels of
      vitamin D with increased gingival inflammation and supporting the concept of
      "continual vitamin D sufficiency" in maintaining periodontal health. The ability 
      of vitamin D to regulate both the innate and the adaptive components of the host 
      response may play an important role in this process. This review will examine the
      skeletal and nonskeletal functions of vitamin D, and explore its potential role
      in protecting the periodontium as well as in regulating periodontal wound
      healing.
