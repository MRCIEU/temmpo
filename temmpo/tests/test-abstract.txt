Abstract
  Various 'omics' technologies, including microarrays and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, can be used to identify hundreds of interesting genes, proteins and metabolites, such as differential genes, proteins and metabolites associated with diseases. Identifying metabolic pathways has become an invaluable aid to understanding the genes and metabolites associated with studying conditions. However, the classical methods used to identify pathways fail to accurately consider joint power of interesting gene/metabolite and the key regions impacted by them within metabolic pathways. In this study, we propose a powerful analytical method referred to as Subpathway-GM for the identification of metabolic subpathways. This provides a more accurate level of pathway analysis by integrating information from genes and metabolites, and their positions and cascade regions within the given pathway. We analyzed two colorectal cancer and one metastatic prostate cancer data sets and demonstrated that Subpathway-GM was able to identify disease-relevant subpathways whose corresponding entire pathways might be ignored using classical entire pathway identification methods. Further analysis indicated that the power of a joint genes/metabolites and subpathway strategy based on their topologies may play a key role in reliably recalling disease-relevant subpathways and finding novel subpathways.

Abstract
  Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) play a crucial role in cancer progression. In the present study we examined the regulation of PAI-1 and uPA expressions in normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3. The antigen and mRNA levels of PAI-1 were down-regulated in cancer cells, especially in LNCaP and DU-145. In the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, an increase of PAI-1 mRNA levels was observed in PrEC, LNCaP and PC-3, but not in DU-145 cells. Treatment with demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased the level of PAI-1 transcript in DU-145 cells and restored the inducing effect of cytokines on PAI-1 expression. An aberrant methylation of PAI-1 promoter in DU-145 and LNCaP cells was shown by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis. PAI-1 methylation was also significantly increased in tumor samples (23.2+/-1.7%) in comparison to adjacent non-tumor tissue (6.0+/-0.8%). Furthermore, the expression of uPA was increased in high invasive cell lines DU-145 and PC-3 in comparison to PrEC and low invasive LNCaP cells. MS-HRM analysis revealed aberrant methylation of uPA promoter in LNCaP cells, but not in PrEC, DU-145 and PC-3 cells, as well as in normal and prostate cancer tissue samples. In conclusion, the study shows that PAI-1 and uPA expressions were changed in opposite directions in high invasive prostate cancer cell lines resulting in a strong decrease of PAI-1/uPA ratio, which may indicate a shift towards proteolytic activities. Methylation of the PAI-1 gene is suggested as one of the molecular mechanisms involved in the cancer-associated down-regulation of the PAI-1 expression. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Molecular knowledge of pure antagonism and systematic SAR study offered a direction for structural optimization of DIMN to provide nicotinamides as a novel series of AR antagonists. Nicotinamides with extended linear scaffold bearing sterically bulky alkoxy groups on isoquinoline end were synthesized for H12 displacement. AR binding affinity and molecular basis of antiandrogenic effect establish the optimized derivatives, 7au and 7bb, as promising candidates of second generation AR antagonists for advanced prostate cancer.

Abstract
  The acquisition of neuroendocrine (NE) characteristics by prostate cancer (PCa) cells is closely related to tumour progression and hormone resistance. The mechanisms by which NE cells influence PCa growth and progression are not fully understood. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in oncogenic processes, and MIF serum levels correlate with aggressiveness of PCa. Here, we investigated the regulation and the functional consequences of MIF expression during NE transdifferentiation of PCa cells. NE differentiation (NED) of LNCaP cells, initiated either by increasing intracellular levels of cAMP or by culturing cells in an androgen-depleted medium, was associated with markedly increased MIF release. Yet, intracellular MIF protein and mRNA levels and MIF gene promoter activity decreased during NED of LNCaP cells, suggesting that NED favours MIF release despite decreasing MIF synthesis. Adenoviral-mediated forced MIF expression in NE-differentiated LNCaP cells increased cell proliferation without affecting the expression of NE markers. Addition of exogenous recombinant MIF to LNCaP and PC-3 cells stimulated the AKT and ERK1/2 signalling pathways, the expression of genes involved in PCa, as well as proliferation and resistance to paclitaxel and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Altogether, these data provide evidence that increased MIF release during NED in PCa may facilitate cancer progression or recurrence, especially following androgen deprivation. Thus, MIF could represent an attractive target for PCa therapy.

Abstract
  17-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17-HSDs) catalyse the 17-position reduction/oxidation of steroids. 17-HSD type 3 (17-HSD3) catalyses the reduction of the weakly androgenic androstenedione (adione) to testosterone, suggesting that specific inhibitors of 17-HSD3 may have a role in the treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. STX2171 is a novel selective non-steroidal 17-HSD3 inhibitor with an IC(50) of ~200nM in a whole-cell assay. It inhibits adione-stimulated proliferation of 17-HSD3-expressing androgen receptor-positive LNCaP(HSD3) prostate cancer cells in vitro. An androgen-stimulated LNCaP(HSD3) xenograft proof-of-concept model was developed to study the efficacies of STX2171 and a more established 17-HSD3 inhibitor, STX1383 (SCH-451659, Schering-Plough), in vivo. Castrated male MF-1 mice were inoculated s.c. with 1x10(7) cells 24h after an initial daily dose of testosterone propionate (TP) or vehicle. After 4 weeks, tumours had not developed in vehicle-dosed mice, but were present in 50% of those mice given TP. One week after switching the stimulus to adione, mice were dosed additionally with the vehicle or inhibitor for a further 4 weeks. Both TP and adione efficiently stimulated tumour growth and increased plasma testosterone levels; however, in the presence of either 17-HSD3 inhibitor, adione-dependent tumour growth was significantly inhibited and plasma testosterone levels reduced. Mouse body weights were unaffected. Both inhibitors also significantly lowered plasma testosterone levels in intact mice. In conclusion, STX2171 and STX1383 significantly lower plasma testosterone levels and inhibit androgen-dependent tumour growth in vivo, indicating that 17-HSD3 inhibitors may have application in the treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer.

Abstract
  Despite advances in detection and therapy, castration-resistant prostate cancer continues to be a major clinical problem. The aberrant activity of stem cell pathways, and their regulation by the Androgen Receptor (AR), has the potential to provide insight into novel mechanisms and pathways to prevent and treat advanced, castrate-resistant prostate cancers. To this end, we investigated the role of the embryonic stem cell regulator Sox2 [SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2] in normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. In the normal prostate, Sox2 is expressed in a portion of basal epithelial cells. Prostate tumors were either Sox2-positive or Sox2-negative, with the percentage of Sox2-positive tumors increasing with Gleason Score and metastases. In the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line CWR-R1, endogenous expression of Sox2 was repressed by AR signaling, and AR chromatin-IP shows that AR binds the enhancer element within the Sox2 promoter. Likewise, in normal prostate epithelial cells and human embryonic stem cells, increased AR signaling also decreases Sox2 expression. Resistance to the anti-androgen MDV3100 results in a marked increase in Sox2 expression within three prostate cancer cell lines, and in the castration-sensitive LAPC-4 prostate cancer cell line ectopic expression of Sox2 was sufficient to promote castration-resistant tumor formation. Loss of Sox2 expression in the castration-resistant CWR-R1 prostate cancer cell line inhibited cell growth. Up-regulation of Sox2 was not associated with increased CD133 expression but was associated with increased FGF5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 5) expression. These data propose a model of elevated Sox2 expression due to loss of AR-mediated repression during castration, and consequent castration-resistance via mechanisms not involving induction of canonical embryonic stem cell pathways.

Abstract
  Disease aggressiveness remains a critical factor to the progression of prostate cancer. Transformation of epithelial cells to mesenchymal lineage, associated with the loss of E-cadherin, offers significant invasive potential and migration capability. Recently, Special AT-rich binding protein (SATB1) has been linked to tumor progression. SATB1 is a cell-type restricted nuclear protein, which functions as a tissue-specific organizer of DNA sequences during cellular differentiation. Our results demonstrate that SATB1 plays significant role in prostate tumor invasion and migration and its nuclear localization correlates with disease aggressiveness. Clinical specimen analysis showed that SATB1 was predominantly expressed in the nucleus of high-grade tumors compared to low-grade tumor and benign tissue. A progressive increase in the nuclear levels of SATB1 was observed in cancer tissues compared to benign specimens. Similarly, SATB1 protein levels were higher in a number of prostate cancer cells viz. HPV-CA-10, DU145, DUPro, PC-3, PC-3M, LNCaP and C4-2B, compared to non-tumorigenic PZ-HPV-7 cells. Nuclear expression of SATB1 was higher in biologically aggressive subclones of prostate cancer cells with their respective parental cell lines. Furthermore, ectopic SATB1 transfection conferred increased cell motility and invasiveness in immortalized human prostate epithelial PZ-HPV-7 cells which correlated with the loss of E-cadherin expression. Consequently, knockdown of SATB1 in highly aggressive human prostate cancer PC-3M cells inhibited invasiveness and tumor growth in vivo along with increase in E-cadherin protein expression. Our findings demonstrate that SATB1 has ability to promote prostate cancer aggressiveness through epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Abstract
  The PTEN tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated in human prostate cancer. Using Osr1 (odd skipped related 1)-Cre mice, we generated a novel conditional Pten knockout mouse strain, Pten(LoxP):Osr1-Cre. Conditional biallelic and monoallelic Pten knockout mice were viable. Deletion of Pten expression was detected in the prostate of Pten(LoxP/LoxP):Osr1-Cre mice as early as 2 weeks of age. Intriguingly, Pten(LoxP/LoxP):Osr1-Cre mice develop high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PINs) with high penetrance as early as one-month of age, and locally invasive prostatic tumors after 12-months of age. Pten(LoxP/+):Osr1-Cre mice show only mild oncogenic changes after 8-weeks of age. Castration of Pten(LoxP/LoxP):Osr1-Cre mice shows no significant regression of prostate tumors, although a shift of androgen receptor (AR) staining from the nuclei to cytoplasm is observed in Pten null tumor cells of castrated mice. Enhanced Akt activity is observed in Pten null tumor cells of castrated Pten(LoxP/LoxP):Osr1-Cre. This study provides a novel mouse model that can be used to investigate a primary role of Pten in initiating oncogenic transformation in the prostate and to examine other genetic and epigenetic changes that are required for tumor progression in the mouse prostate.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that serve as important post-transcriptional gene expression regulators by targeting messenger RNAs for post-transcriptional endonucleolytic cleavage or translational inhibition. miRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. Extensive high-throughput sequencing studies of miRNAs have been performed in several animal models. However, little is known about the diversity of these regulatory RNAs in goat (Capra hircus), which is one of the most important agricultural animals and the oldest domesticated species raised worldwide. Goats have long been used for their milk, meat, hair (including cashmere), and skins throughout much of the world.

  RESULTS: In this study, two small RNA libraries were constructed based on dry period and peak lactation dairy goat mammary gland tissues and sequenced using the Illumina-Solexa high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 346 conserved and 95 novel miRNAs were identified in the dairy goat. miRNAs expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR in nine tissues and in the mammary gland during different stages of lactation. In addition, several candidate miRNAs that may be involved in mammary gland development and lactation were found by comparing the miRNA expression profiles in different tissues and developmental stages of the mammary gland.

  CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the first miRNAs profile related to the biology of the mammary gland in the dairy goat. The characterization of these miRNAs could contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lactation physiology and mammary gland development in the dairy goat.

Abstract
  Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vascular beds, is essential for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Luteolin is a common dietary flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables. We studied the antiangiogenic activity of luteolin using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models. In vitro studies using rat aortic ring assay showed that luteolin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells, which are key events in the process of angiogenesis. Luteolin also inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM) and matrigel plug assay. Gelatin zymographic analysis demonstrated the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the activation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. Western blot analysis showed that luteolin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT, ERK, mTOR, P70S6K, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in HUVECs. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- level were significantly reduced by the treatment of luteolin in PC-3 cells. Luteolin (10 mg/kg/d) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model, indicating that luteolin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis. CD31 and CD34 immunohistochemical staining further revealed that the microvessel density could be remarkably suppressed by luteolin. Moreover, luteolin reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT, ERK, mTOR, P70S6K, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expressions. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that luteolin inhibits human prostate tumor growth by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-mediated angiogenesis.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The Chilean Ministry of Health has combated iron deficiency through the delivery of fortified milk by the National Complementary Feeding Program (NCFP).

  OBJECTIVE: To assess iron status and associations between biomarkers of iron status and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in 218 beneficiaries of the NCFP aged 19 to 72 months in Santiago and Valparaiso, Chile.

  METHODS: Blood was collected from a cross-sectional representative sample. Iron status (measured by hemoglobin, zinc protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin levels) and inflammation (according to CRP level) were determined.

  RESULTS: Serum CRP level was positively associated with serum ferritin and zinc protoporphyrin levels (r = 0.16 and r = 0.15; p = .0168 and p = .0290, respectively). Serum ferritin was higher among children with high CRP (> 10 mg/dL) than among those with low CRP (< or = 10 mg/dL) (p = .003). After adjustment for 10, 6, and 5 mg/L CRP, the prevalence of low serum ferritin changed from 56.4% without adjustment to 60.6%, 61.5%, and 42.7%, respectively, and the prevalence of high zinc protoporphyrin changed from 22.9% to 21.6%, 17.4%, and 17.9%, respectively. There were no differences between regions in biomarkers of iron status. There was no association between consumption of fortified milk and the prevalence of abnormal serum ferritin (< 15 microg/L) after adjustment for sex, age, and breastfeeding (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.01; p = .288). After adjustment for 10 mg/L CRP, 5.5% were classified as having iron-deficiency anemia, 42.7% as having iron-deficiency erythropoiesis, 17.9% as having depleted iron stores, and 35.8% as having normal iron status. CONCLUSIONS. CRP level was positively associated with: serum ferritin and zinc protoporphyrin levels. Chilean children aged 19 to 72 months from Santiago and Valparaiso who were beneficiaries of the NCFP had a low prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia, a high prevalence of iron-deficiency erythropoiesis, and a moderate prevalence of depleted iron stores.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Prostate cancer has been described as a component tumor of Lynch syndrome (LS), with tumors obtained from mutation carriers demonstrating the DNA mismatch repair deficiency phenotype. Previous studies quantifying prostate cancer risk in LS have provided conflicting results.

  METHODS: We examined cancer histories of probands and their first- through fourth-degree relatives for 198 independent mutation-positive LS families enrolled in two US familial cancer registries. Modified segregation analysis was used to calculate age-specific cumulative risk or penetrance estimates, with accompanying Wald-type CIs. Cumulative lifetime risks and hazard ratio (HR) estimates for prostate cancer were calculated and compared with those of the general population.

  RESULTS: Ninety-seven cases of prostate cancer were observed in 4,127 men. Median age at prostate cancer diagnosis was 65 years (range, 38 to 89 years), with 11.53% of affected individuals diagnosed before age 50 years. The cumulative risk of prostate cancer at ages 60 and 80 years was 6.30% (95% CI, 2.47 to 9.96) and 30.0% (95% CI, 16.54 to 41.30), as compared with the population risk of 2.59% and 17.84%, respectively. The overall prostate cancer HR among carriers was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.31 to 3.03).

  CONCLUSION: The cumulative lifetime risk of prostate cancer in individuals with LS is two-fold higher than in the general population and is slightly higher in carriers diagnosed before age 60 years (HR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.34 to 4.59). These estimates are clinically valuable to quantify risk for both patients and providers.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The primary risk for prostate cancer is aging, often associated with inflammation. Evidence implicates progressive age-related immune dysfunction with increased prostate cancer incidence and mortality. The aged T-cell response is characterized by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could significantly contribute to prostate tumorigenesis through induction of key inflammation-mediated pro-survival factors.

  METHODS: T-cell function of the young (<6 month-old) glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (GPAT-1) knock-out mouse mimics many of the hallmarks observed in an aged (>22-month-old) mouse. Serum and splenic T-lymphocytes from young GPAT-1(-/-) (6 months) and aged wild type (22 months) mice were collected for in vitro studies, including a cytokine immunoarray for serum cytokine levels, luciferase assays for NF-kB activation and Western blot analyses for protein expression.

  RESULTS: The T-cell cytokine profile of the GPAT-1(-/-) mice mirrored that observed in aged wild type mice, including higher expression levels of IL-17. Serum- and T-cell-derived factors induced NF-kB activity in normal, non-transformed and prostate cancer epithelial cells, correlating with re-localization of NF-kB and increased protein expression of downstream targets of NF-kB.

  CONCLUSION: The aging and aging-mimic mice produced circulating factors that induce pro-inflammatory pathways in prostate cells, most notably NF-kB. These findings provide evidence that an aged T-cell may directly contribute to the increased risk for prostate cancer in the elderly and establish that the GPAT-1(-/-) model, which mimics many of the characteristics of an aged immune system, is a viable tool for investigating this novel area of cancer risk.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies indicate that calcium channel blocker (CCB) use is inversely related to prostate cancer (PCa) incidence. The association between CCB use and PCa aggressiveness at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP) and outcome after RP was examined.

  METHODS: Medication use, PCa aggressiveness and post-RP outcome were retrieved from a prospectively populated database that contains clinical and outcome for RP patients at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) from 1993 to 2010. The database was queried for anti-hypertensive medication use at diagnosis for patients with >=1 year follow-up. Recurrence was defined using NCCN guidelines. Chi-Square tests assessed the relationship between CCB use and PCa aggressiveness. Cox regression models compared the distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with adjustment for covariates. Results for association between CCB usage and PCa aggressiveness were validated using data from the population-based North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP).

  RESULTS: 48%, 37%, and 15% of RPCI's RP patients (n=875) had low, intermediate, and high aggressive PCa, respectively. 104 (11%) had a history of CCB use. Patients taking CCBs were more likely to be older, have a higher BMI and use additional anti-hypertensive medications. Diagnostic PSA levels, PCa aggressiveness, and margin status were similar for CCB users and non-users. PFS and OS did not differ between the two groups. Tumor aggressiveness was associated with PFS. CCB use in the PCaP study population was not associated with PCa aggressiveness.

  CONCLUSIONS: CCB use is not associated with PCa aggressiveness at diagnosis, PFS or OS. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Development of high affinity and specificity molecular imaging probes that increase accuracy for early detection of lymph node (LN) metastases is important for improving survivorship in prostate cancer. We evaluated the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of fluorescence-labeled bombesin (BBN) peptides to detect LN and systematic metastases in orthotopic mouse models bearing gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-positive human prostate cancer.

  METHODS: PC-3 cells were orthotopically implanted in severe combined immunedeficient or thymic nude (nu/nu) male mice. Tumor growth was monitored using magnetic resonance imaging. Alexa Fluor 680 conjugated BBN[7-14]NH2 (AF680-BBN) peptides were administered intravenously at 4-7 weeks post-tumor-implantation. Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging was performed for up to 6 hr post-injection. The imaging sensitivity and specificity were assessed by co-registration of AF680-BBN NIRF imaging and luciferase bioluminescence imaging of the PC-3/Luc+ orthotopic mouse model.

  RESULTS: AF680-BBN showed a high binding affinity and selectivity to GRPR-positive cancer in vitro and in vivo. LN and peritoneal metastases were detected by NIRF imaging, and confirmed by histopathology. Tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio was the highest at 2-hr post-injection (4.12+/-1.77). Blocking experiments, using unlabeled BBN as the inhibiting agent, significantly reduced the T/M ratio (1.64+/-0.21, P=0.02). AF680-BBN NIRF imaging had a sensitivity of 89.4%, specificity of 92.9%, and accuracy of 90.2% for the detection of metastases in mice. CONCULSIONS: The studies suggest the potential of use and development of NIR-fluorescent BBN probes as site-directed agents to help improve the current detection and LN staging accuracy in prostate cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prostate tumors shed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) into the blood stream. Increased evidence shows that CTCs are often present in metastatic prostate cancer and can be alternative sources for disease profiling and prognostication. Here we postulate that CTCs expressing genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are strong predictors of metastatic prostate cancer.

  METHODS: A microfiltration system was used to trap CTCs from peripheral blood based on size selection of large epithelial-like cells without CD45 leukocyte marker. These cells individually retrieved with a micromanipulator device were assessed for cell membrane physical properties using atomic force microscopy. Additionally, 38 CTCs from eight prostate cancer patients were used to determine expression profiles of 84 EMT-related and reference genes using a microfluidics-based PCR system.

  RESULTS: Increased cell elasticity and membrane smoothness were found in CTCs compared to noncancerous cells, highlighting their potential invasiveness and mobility in the peripheral circulation. Despite heterogeneous expression patterns of individual CTCs, genes that promote mesenchymal transitioning into a more malignant state, including IGF1, IGF2, EGFR, FOXP3, and TGFB3, were commonly observed in these cells. An additional subset of EMT-related genes (e.g., PTPRN2, ALDH1, ESR2, and WNT5A) were expressed in CTCs of castration-resistant cancer, but less frequently in castration-sensitive cancer.

  CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that an incremental expression of EMT-related genes in CTCs is associated with metastatic castration-resistant cancer. Although CTCs represent a group of highly heterogeneous cells, their unique EMT-related gene signatures provide a new opportunity for personalized treatments with targeted inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Regulated activation of p38 is crucial for cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Our previous studies had showed that prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) can facilitate the proliferation, migration, survival of the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, but the mechanisms are poorly defined.

  METHODS: Our LNCaP cells had been stably transfected with lentivirus-mediated shRNA for PSMA silencing in previous study. We first testify the efficacy of PSMA knockdown in our LNCaP cell line. Then using this PSMA (-) LNCaP cell line, we compared the expression of PSMA and P-p38 by Western blotting among groups. Furthermore, we also performed immunofluorescence to confirm the change of P-p38 in cells. Then, cell viability and migration were measured by cell counting kit-8 reagent and Transwell analysis respectively. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cell survival.

  RESULTS: After silencing the expression of PSMA, the level of the phospho-p38 (P-p38) decreased approximate 40% compared with the blank and NC groups (P<0.05). When the cells were incubated with SB203582 (p38 inhibitor), the P-p38 in three groups was at low level and no difference among groups (P>0.05). Then the results of immunofluorescence further proved the relationship between PSMA and P-p38. Decrease of cell viability, migration, and survival was observed upon PSMA silencing. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK pathway, also reduced proliferation, migration, and survival of LNCaP cells.

  CONCLUSION: These data suggests PSMA may stimulate prostate cancer cells proliferation, migration and survival through p38 MAPK pathway, revealing a novel mechanism for PSMA playing positive role on LNCaP cells. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine (NE) cells promote the progression of prostate cancer to a castration-resistant state through the production of paracrine growth factors. We have demonstrated this principle using in vitro and in vivo proliferative endpoints; however, the contributions of NE-derived pro-survival factors and anti-apoptosis to this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated.

  METHODS: Here, we utilized conditioned-medium (CM) from LNCaP cells, engineered to undergo NE differentiation, and examined its effects on PC3 and LNCaP cell survival.

  RESULTS: Statistically significant changes in clonogenic survival, Annexin V staining, PARP cleavage and trypan blue positivity of approximately twofold were observed in the presence of NE-derived CM relative to control-CM for both LNCaP and PC3 cells. These changes were partially abrogated by antagonists of the neuropeptides neurotensin, bombesin, and PTHrP. Selective inhibitors of IGF-1R, EGFR or Src caused significant and nearly complete blockade of prostate cancer cell survival due to NE secretions. Similar increases in cell survival were observed for LNCaP or PC3 cells treated with NE-derived medium in the presence of docetaxel. Increased phosphorylation of IGF-1R, following treatment with NE-derived medium, was accompanied by decreased protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type F (PTPRF) mRNA, and protein levels. Overexpression of PTPRF decreased cell survival, the amplitude and duration of IGF-1R phosphorylation, and enhanced PARP cleavage in the presence of NE-derived medium.

  CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that NE-derived factors act upon prostate cancer cells to stimulate pro-survival signaling and describe a novel mechanism of cross-talk between NE-derived factors and IGF-1R, mediated in part by PTPRF. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Expression profiles of some microRNAs (miRNAs) were associated with clinicopathological findings in human prostate cancer (PC), but the relative expression of miRNAs among Gleason patterns (GPs) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression of several known microRNAs in each GP of PC.

  METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were obtained from radical prostatectomy (RP) (patient set 1, n=43, including (GP 3) n=22, (GP 4) n=35, and (GP 5) n=12) and needle biopsy (patient set 2, n=10, (GP 4) n=10). Cancer tissues from each GP and adjacent normal counterparts were separately collected using laser-captured microdissection (LCM). Real-time RT-PCR was performed to determine the relative expression of miRNAs, including miR-31-5p, -34c-5p, -96-5p, -182-5p, -183-5p, -205-5p, -221-3p, and -222-3p, which were currently reported to be involved in PC progression.

  RESULTS: In radical prostatectomy samples, relative expression of miR-31-5p, miR-34c-5p, and miR-205-5p in any GP was significantly decreased compared to normal counterpart. However, no significant difference was detected among GP 3, GP 4, and GP 5. Meanwhile, in the same GP4, expression of miR-31-5p miR-182-5p, and miR-205-5p in cancer tissues obtained from high grade cancer was significantly higher than those obtained from intermediate grade cancer. Validation study using biopsy samples revealed that the relative expression of miR-182-5p was statistically higher in high grade cancer even in same GP4.

  CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the expression of miR-182-5p depended on the cancer grade even in same GP 4. Expression of miRNA associated with Gleason grading system may contribute to more accurate preoperative cancer risk evaluation. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  Diabetic nephropathy, as a severe microvascular complication of diabetic mellitus, has become the leading cause of end-stage renal diseases. However, no effective therapeutic strategy has been developed to prevent renal damage progression to end stage renal disease. Hence, the present study evaluated the protective effects of grape seed procyanidin B2 (GSPB2) and explored its molecular targets underlying diabetic nephropathy by a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis in db/db mice. Here, we found that oral administration of GSPB2 significantly attenuated the renal dysfunction and pathological changes in db/db mice. Proteome analysis by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) identified 53 down-regulated and 60 up-regulated proteins after treatment with GSPB2 in db/db mice. Western blot analysis confirmed that milk fat globule EGF-8 (MFG-E8) was significantly up-regulated in diabetic kidney. MFG-E8 silencing by transfection of MFG-E8 shRNA improved renal histological lesions by inhibiting phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3) in kidneys of db/db mice. In contrast, over-expression of MFG-E8 by injection of recombinant MFG-E8 resulted in the opposite effects. GSPB2 treatment significantly decreased protein levels of MFG-E8, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-Akt, and phospho-GSK-3 in the kidneys of db/db mice. These findings yield insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, revealing MFG-E8 as a new therapeutic target and indicating GSPB2 as a prospective therapy by down-regulation of MFG-E8, along with ERK1/2, Akt and GSK-3 signaling pathway.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nutritional adequacy of diets in early childhood as a function of milk intake, cows' milk (CM) or growing-up milk (GUM).

  DESIGN: From a cross-sectional food consumption survey, two groups of children aged 1-2 years were defined: group CM fed exclusively on CM >= 250 ml/d and group GUM fed on GUM >= 250 ml/d. Proportions of children at risk of nutrient excess or insufficiency were estimated relative to the French recommended daily allowances, estimated average requirements or adequate intakes.

  SETTING: Parents participating in the survey were recruited from all regions of France by a polling organization. Distribution was adjusted to that of the French population.

  SUBJECTS: Sixty-three (group CM) and fifty-five (group GUM) children.

  RESULTS: Total energy and macronutrient intakes were similar in the two groups except protein intake of group CM, which was much higher than the Recommended Daily Allowance and significantly higher than in group GUM. A high percentage of children of Group CM had intake of linoleic acid (51%) and -linolenic acid (84%) below the lower limit of the adequate intake, and intake of Fe (59%) vitamin C (49%) and alimentary vitamin D (100%) less than the Estimated Average Requirement. Significant differences were observed in the proportions of children with a risk of dietary inadequacy between the two groups for all the mentioned nutrients (P < 0.001). In group GUM, this imbalance was only observed for vitamin D. Intake of foods other than milk and dairy products could not account for these discrepancies.

  CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of CM (>=250 ml/d) entails the risk of insufficiency in -linolenic acid, Fe, vitamin C and vitamin D. Use of GUM (>=250 ml/d) significantly reduces the risk of insufficiencies in the mentioned nutrients.

Abstract
  PSMA-VRP is a propagation defective, viral replicon vector system encoding PSMA under phase I evaluation for patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC). The product is derived from an attenuated strain of the alphavirus, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus, and incorporates multiple redundant safety features. In this first in human trial, two cohorts of 3 patients with CRPC metastatic to bone were treated with up to five doses of either 0.9x10(7)IU or 0.36x10(8)IU of PSMA-VRP at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10 and 18, followed by an expansion cohort of 6 patients treated with 0.36x10(8)IU of PSMA-VRP at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10 and 18. No toxicities were observed. In the first dose cohort, no PSMA specific cellular immune responses were seen but weak PSMA-specific signals were observed by ELISA. The remaining 9 patients, which included the higher cohort and the extension cohort, had no PSMA specific cellular responses. PSMA-VRP was well-tolerated at both doses. While there did not appear to be clinical benefit nor robust immune signals at the two doses studied, neutralizing antibodies were produced by both cohorts suggesting that dosing was suboptimal.

Abstract
  A study was undertaken to evaluate the nutritional response of organically grown diets in buffaloes on nutrients utilization and nutrient efficiency for milk production. For this, ten milch Murrah buffaloes of average body weight (490.72 +/- 6.65 kg), milk yield (8.13 +/- 0.33 kg), and lactation stage (85 +/- 5.28 days) were distributed in inorganic (InDg()) and organic dietary groups (OrDg) with five animals in each. Buffaloes of InDg and OgDg were fed sorghum hay-berseem fodder-concentrate mixture-based diets grown inorganically and organically, respectively. After 60 days of feeding, a digestion cum metabolism trial was conducted to assess feed intake, nutrient utilization, and N balance, while milk yield and composition were recorded fortnightly. DM, CP, digestible crude protein (DCP), and metabolizable energy (ME) intake (g/Kg w(0.75)) were similar in animals of InDg and OrDg. NDF, ADF, and hemicellulose digestibility were (P < 0.05) higher in animals on OrDg (59.20, 51.55, and 62.67) than InDg diet (54.57, 43.72, and 56.61 %), respectively. Urinary n loss (g/day) was (P < 0.05) lower in OrDg (67.23) than in InDg (83.55); however, milk N was comparable in animals of both dietary groups (47.36 vs 45.82 g/day). Nitrogen balance was higher in animals of OrDg (39.72) than in InDg (28.08). DCP, TDN, and ME values of both diets were similar. No effect of diet was observed on milk yield and its composition; however, increased lactation length decreased milk yield. Buffaloes on both diets had similar efficiency and conversion ratio of nutrients for milk production. Results revealed that diets (organically vs. inorganically grown) have no effect on milk yield and its composition; however, buffaloes on organic diet have higher fiber digestibility and low urinary N loss which did not affect the dietary nutrients efficiency and conversion ratio for milk production.

Abstract
  This study investigated effects of unsaturated zone depth on nitrogen removal via simultaneous nitritation and anammox in three vertical flow recirculating biofilters. The biofilters had different depths (25, 40, and 60 cm) of an unsaturated zone and the same depth (35 cm) of a saturated zone. Unsaturated zone depth could be regulated to maintain suitable dissolved oxygen concentrations and enhance entrapment of carbon dioxide for co-occurrence of aerobic ammonia oxidation and anammox in the saturated zones. The biofilters with the larger unsaturated zones had higher ammonium and total inorganic nitrogen removal rates (16.2-33.5 g N/m(3)/d and 4.6-16.7 g N/m(3)/d, respectively) than the biofilter with the smallest unsaturated zone (11.9-18.1 g N/m(3)/d and 4.4-7.9 g N/m(3)/d, respectively). Electric arc furnace slag and marble chips were packed in the unsaturated and saturated zones, respectively, as low-cost materials to supplement alkalinity and buffer pH. Laboratory experiments showed that the maximum alkalinity dissolution efficiency was 513 mg CaCO(3)/kg marble chips and 761 mg CaCO(3)/kg electric arc furnace slag. Marble chips and electric arc furnace slag could increase dairy wastewater pH up to 7 and 9, respectively. The laboratory results are also useful for utilization of furnace slag and marble chips in constructed wetlands. Copyright  2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Multimerization of peptides can improve the binding characteristics of the tracer by increasing local ligand concentration and decreasing dissociation kinetics. In this study, a new bombesin homodimer was developed based on an -aminocaproic acid-bombesin(7-14) (Aca-bombesin(7-14)) fragment, which has been studied for targeting the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in prostate cancer. The bombesin homodimer was conjugated to 6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (HYNIC) and labeled with (99m)Tc for SPECT imaging. The in vitro binding affinity to GRPR, cell uptake, internalization and efflux kinetics of the radiolabeled bombesin dimer were investigated in the GRPR-expressing human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Biodistribution and the GRPR-targeting potential were evaluated in PC-3 tumor-bearing athymic nude mice. When compared with the bombesin monomer, the binding affinity of the bombesin dimer is about ten times lower. However, the (99m)Tc labeled bombesin dimer showed a three times higher cellular uptake at 4 h after incubation, but similar internalization and efflux characters in vitro. Tumor uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetics in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice were comparable. The tumor was visible on the dynamic images in the first hour and could be clearly distinguished from non-targeted tissues on the static images after 4 h. The GRPR-targeting ability of the (99m)Tc labeled bombesin dimer was proven in vitro and in vivo. This bombesin homodimer provides a good starting point for further studies on enhancing the tumor targeting activity of bombesin multimers.

Abstract
  Lactation is a process associated with mammals, yet a number of birds feed their newly hatched young on secretions analogous to the milk of mammals. These secretions are produced from various sections (crop organ, oesophageal lining and proventriculus) of the upper digestive tract and possess similar levels of fat and protein, as well as added carotenoids, antibodies and, in the case of pigeons and doves, epidermal growth factor. Parental care in avian species has been proposed to originate from dinosaurs. This study examines the possibility that some dinosaurs used secretory feeding to increase the rate of growth of their young, estimated to be similar to that of present day birds and mammals. Dinosaur 'lactation' could also have facilitated immune responses as well as extending parental protection as a result of feeding newly hatched young in nest environments. While the arguments for dinosaur lactation are somewhat generic, a case study for lactation in herbivorous site-nesting dinosaurs is presented. It is proposes that secretory feeding could have been used to bridge the gap between hatching and establishment of the normal diet in some dinosaurs.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: We evaluated the perioperative serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with open or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RP) and assessed the surgical stress based on the cytokine levels in addition to conventional clinical stress markers after surgery.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-five patients who received RP for clinically localized PCa were enrolled. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-, IL-1, IL-8, and IL-12p70 were quantitatively measured using a multiplex bead array at three time points (i.e., before the operation [pre-OP], immediately after the operation [post-OP], and on postoperative Day 1 [POD1]). The perioperative changes in serum stress markers, including cytokines, were compared between patients who underwent open and laparoscopic RP, and the predictors for high levels of postoperative cytokines were assessed.

  RESULTS: The median age and estimated blood loss were significantly lower in the laparoscopic RP group than in the open RP group (P=.003 and P<.01, respectively). In all patients, body temperature, white blood cell count, and serum IL-10 and IL-6 levels were significantly higher at post-OP and POD1 than at pre-OP. Patients who underwent laparoscopic RP had significantly lower levels of serum IL-10, IL-6, and IL-1 at post-OP and POD1 than those who underwent open RP. Multivariate regression analyses showed that the surgical group (open versus laparoscopic) was an independent influencing factor on the levels of serum IL-6 and IL-10 at POD1 (P=.031 and P<.004, respectively) among various clinical perioperative parameters.

  CONCLUSIONS: Several inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and IL-10, are potential surgical stress markers in patients with PCa treated with RP. Based on cytokine production, our data support the view that laparoscopic RP is less invasive than open RP.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Early-onset and exclusive breast-feeding provides a significant health benefit to infants compared with infant formulas. The aim of this study was to compare mature breast milk with standard infant formulas by examining their effects on non-vascular smooth muscle contraction and their antioxidative properties.

  METHODS: The pharmacologic effects of breast milk and formulas were examined using a model system of the rat uterine smooth muscle contraction. Electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping spectroscopy was used to compare the antioxidative capacities of breast milk (obtained in the ninth week of lactation) with commercial infant formulas against hydroxyl radical production in the Fenton reaction. The activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and the sulfhydryl group were determined in the breast milk and infant formulas.

  RESULTS: In contrast to the infant formulas, breast milk exerted a relaxing effect on isolated non-vascular smooth muscle. In general, breast milk showed higher antioxidative activity compared with the infant formulas. In all samples, the generation of hydroxyl radicals led to the formation of carbon-centered and ascorbyl radicals.

  CONCLUSIONS: Human milk exerts direct pharmacologic relaxation effects and provides better antioxidant protection compared with infant formulas because of the presence of specific enzymatic components, such as human superoxide dismutase. We propose that these effects should be advantageous to an infant's gastrointestinal tract by supporting the normal work of the smooth musculature and maintaining redox homeostasis and may represent one of the mechanisms by which breast-feeding benefits health.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Gamma-synuclein (SNCG) has previously been demonstrated to be significantly correlated with metastatic malignancies; however, in-depth investigation of SNCG in prostate cancer is still lacking. In the present study, we evaluated the role of SNCG in prostate cancer progression and explored the underlying mechanisms.

  METHODS: First, alteration of SNCG expression in LNCaP cell line to test the ability of SNCG on cellular properties in vitro and vivo whenever exposing with androgen or not. Subsequently, the Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to evaluate whether the role of SNCG in LNCaP is through AR signaling. Last, the association between SNCG and prostate cancer progression was assessed immunohistochemically using a series of human prostate tissues.

  RESULTS: Silencing SNCG by siRNA in LNCaP cells contributes to the inhibition of cellular proliferation, the induction of cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase, the suppression of cellular migration and invasion in vitro, as well as the decrease of tumor growth in vivo with the notable exception of castrated mice. Subsequently, mechanistic studies indicated that SNCG is a novel androgen receptor (AR) coactivator. It interacts with AR and promotes prostate cancer cellular growth and proliferation by activating AR transcription in an androgen-dependent manner. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SNCG was almost undetectable in benign or androgen-independent tissues prostate lesions. The high expression of SNCG is correlated with peripheral and lymph node invasion.

  CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that SNCG may serve as a biomarker for predicting human prostate cancer progression and metastasis. It also may become as a novel target for biomedical therapy in advanced prostate cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Treatment of subclinical mastitis during lactation can have both direct (individual animal level) and indirect (population level) effects. With a few exceptions, prior research has focused on evaluating the direct effects of mastitis treatment, and to date no controlled field trials have been conducted to test whether beneficial indirect effects of lactation treatment strategies targeting subclinical mastitis can be demonstrated on commercial dairy farms. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge on the impact of such interventions on the population dynamics of specific bacterial strains. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that lactation therapy targeting S. aureus subclinical intramammary infection reduces transmission of S. aureus strains within dairy herds. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used to determine strain specific infection dynamics in treated and control groups in a split herd trial conducted on 2 commercial dairy farms.

  RESULTS: The direct effect of 8 days intramammary lactation therapy with pirlimycin hydrochloride was demonstrated by an increased proportion of cure and a reduction in duration of infection in quarters receiving treatment compared to untreated controls. The indirect effect of lactation therapy was demonstrated by reduction of new S. aureus intramammary infections (IMI) caused by the dominant strain type in both herds. Strain typing of representative isolates taken over the duration of all IMI, including pre- and post-treatment isolates, provided more precise estimates of new infection, cure, and re-infection rates. New S. aureus infections in recovered susceptible quarters and the emergence of a new strain type in one herd influenced incidence measures.

  CONCLUSION: In addition to demonstrating positive direct effects of lactation therapy, this study provides evidence that treatment of subclinical S. aureus mastitis during lactation can have indirect effects including preventing new IMI and reducing incidence of clinical mastitis within dairy herds. Strain specific transmission parameter estimates for S. aureus MLST clonal complexes 5, 97 and 705 in 2 commercial dairy herds are also reported.

Abstract
  The p160 steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) SRC-1, SRC-2 [nuclear receptor coactivator (NCOA)2], and SRC-3 [amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1)/NCOA3] are key pleiotropic "master regulators" of transcription factor activity necessary for cancer cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and metastasis. SRC overexpression and overactivation occur in numerous human cancers and are associated with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to therapy. In prostate cancer (PC), the p160 SRCs play critical roles in androgen receptor transcriptional activity, cell proliferation, and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. We recently demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor speckle-type poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) domain protein (SPOP) interacts directly with SRC-3 and promotes its cullin 3-dependent ubiquitination and proteolysis in breast cancer, thus functioning as a potential tumor suppressor. Interestingly, somatic heterozygous missense mutations in the SPOP substrate-binding cleft recently were identified in up to 15% of human PCs (making SPOP the gene most commonly affected by nonsynonymous point mutations in PC), but their contribution to PC pathophysiology remains unknown. We now report that PC-associated SPOP mutants cannot interact with SRC-3 protein or promote its ubiquitination and degradation. Our data suggest that wild-type SPOP plays a critical tumor suppressor role in PC cells, promoting the turnover of SRC-3 protein and suppressing androgen receptor transcriptional activity. This tumor suppressor effect is abrogated by the PC-associated SPOP mutations. These studies provide a possible explanation for the role of SPOP mutations in PC, and highlight the potential of SRC-3 as a therapeutic target in PC.

Abstract
  The androgen receptor (AR) is a key molecule involved in prostate cancer (PC) development and progression. Post-translational modification of the AR by co-regulator proteins can modulate its transcriptional activity. To identify which demethylases might be involved in AR regulation, an siRNA screen was performed to reveal that the demethylase, KDM4B, may be an important co-regulator protein. KDM4B enzymatic activity is required to enhance AR transcriptional activity; however, independently of this activity, KDM4B can enhance AR protein stability via inhibition of AR ubiquitination. Importantly, knockdown of KDM4B in multiple cell lines results in almost complete depletion of AR protein levels. For the first time, we have identified KDM4B to be an androgen-regulated demethylase enzyme, which can influence AR transcriptional activity not only via demethylation activity but also via modulation of ubiquitination. Together, these findings demonstrate the close functional relationship between AR and KDM4B, which work together to amplify the androgen response. Furthermore, KDM4B expression in clinical PC specimens positively correlates with increasing cancer grade (P < 0.001). Consequently, KDM4B is a viable therapeutic target in PC.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Advanced prostate cancer is treated by hormone ablation therapy. However, despite an initial response, the majority of men relapse to develop castration-resistant disease for which there are no effective treatments. We have previously shown that manipulating individual proteins has only minor alterations on the resistant phenotype so we hypothesize that targeting the central transcription factors (TFs) would represent a better therapeutic approach.

  METHODS: We have undertaken a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression differences between the androgen-dependent LNCaP parental cells and its castration-resistant Abl and Hof sublines, revealing 1,660 genes associated with castration-resistance. Using effective bioinformatic techniques, these transcriptomic data were integrated with TF binding sites resulting in a list of TFs associated with the differential gene expression observed.

  RESULTS: Following validation of the gene-chip results, the serum response factor (SRF) was chosen for clinical validation and functional analysis due to its recent association with prostate cancer progression. SRF immunoreactivity in prostate tumor samples was shown for the first time to be associated with castration-resistance. SRF inhibition by siRNA and the small molecule inhibitor CCG-1423 resulted in decreased proliferation.

  CONCLUSION: SRF is a key TF by which resistant cells survive with depleted levels of androgens representing a target for therapeutic manipulation. Copyright  2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of monocarboxylates such as pyruvate and lactate. In a previous study we described overexpression of MCT2 in prostate carcinoma raising the hypothesis of using MCT2 as a possible biomarker in prostate cancer. With the present study we aimed to compare the pattern of expression of MCT2 and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), in prostate carcinoma, PIN lesions, non-neoplastic prostate tissue, and normal prostate and compare their sensitivity and specificity. Also, we wanted to evaluate the value of using MCT2 in combination with AMACR and the negative markers 34E12 or p63 to detect prostate cancer.

  METHODS: A total of 349 cases, including prostate carcinoma, non-neoplastic prostate tissue and PIN lesions, from radical prostatectomies were examined by immunohistochemistry for AMACR, MCT2, p63, and 34E12, using tissue microarrays (TMAs). Normal prostate from radical cystoprostatectomy was also studied.

  RESULTS: Our study revealed that MCT2, similarly to AMACR, was consistently expressed in prostate cancer regardless of the Gleason score. In combination with AMACR and p63 or 34E12, MCT2 helped to improve the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma. Also, overexpression of MCT2 as well as AMACR in PIN lesions may indicate the involvement of these two proteins in prostate cancer initiation.

  CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence for the presence of MCT2 in prostate cancer, selectively labeling malignant glands. Importantly, assessment of MCT2 together with AMACR, along with the negative markers, highly increases the accuracy in prostate cancer diagnosis. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Resveratrol increases lifespan and decreases the risk of many cancers. We hypothesized resveratrol will slow the growth of human prostate cancer xenografts.

  METHODS: SCID mice were fed Western diet (40% fat, 44% carbohydrate, 16% protein by kcal). One week later, human prostate cancer cells, either LAPC-4 (151 mice) or LNCaP (94 mice) were injected subcutaneously. Three weeks after injection, LAPC-4 mice were randomized to Western diet (control group), Western diet plus resveratrol 50 mg/kg/day, or Western diet plus resveratrol 100 mg/kg/day. The LNCaP mice were randomized to Western diet or Western diet plus resveratrol 50 mg/kg/day. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 1,000 mm(3). Survival differences among groups were assessed using Cox proportional hazards. Serum insulin and IGF axis were assessed using ELISAs. Gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix gene arrays.

  RESULTS: Compared to control in the LAPC-4 study, resveratrol was associated with decreased survival (50 mg/kg/day--HR 1.53, P = 0.04; 100 mg/kg/day--HR 1.22, P = 0.32). In the LNCaP study, resveratrol did not change survival (HR 0.77, P = 0.22). In combined analysis of both resveratrol 50 mg/kg/day groups, IGF-1 was decreased (P = 0.05) and IGFBP-2 was increased (P = 0.01). Resveratrol induced different patterns of gene expression changes in each xenograft model, with upregulation of oncogenic pathways E2F3 and beta-catenin in LAPC-4 tumors.

  CONCLUSION: Resveratrol was associated with significantly worse survival with LAPC-4 tumors, but unchanged survival with LNCaP. Based on these preliminary data that resveratrol may be harmful, caution should be advised in using resveratrol for patients until further studies can be conducted.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: While several studies showed that selenium may prevent prostate cancer (PCa), few studies have evaluated variation in selenoenzyme genes in relation to PCa risk and survival.

  METHODS: We studied common variants in seven selenoenzymes genes in relation to risk of PCa and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM). In a population-based case-control study of men of European ancestry (1,309 cases, 1,266 controls), we evaluated 35 common, tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPX1 (n = 2), GPX2 (n = 4), GPX3 (n = 6), GPX4 (n = 6), SEP15 (n = 4), SEPP1 (n = 6), and TXNRD1 (n = 7) in relation to PCa risk, and among cases, associations between these variants and risk of PCSM. We used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the relative risk of PCa and PCSM, respectively.

  RESULTS: Of the SNPs examined, only GPX1 rs3448 was associated with overall PCa risk with an odds ratio of 0.62 for TT versus CC (95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.88). SNPs in GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, SEP15, and SEPP1 had different risk estimates for PCa in subgroups based on stage and grade. We observed associations between SNPs in GPX4, and TXNRD1 and risk of PCSM. None of these associations, however, remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

  CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that genetic variation in a subset of selenoenzyme genes may alter risk of PCa and PCSM. These results need validation in additional subsets. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In the adult human prostate CD133 expression is thought to mark rare prostate epithelial stem cells and malignant tumor stem/initiating cells. Such putative stem cell populations are thought to proliferate slowly, but possess unlimited proliferative potential. Based on this, we hypothesized that CD133(pos) prostate cancer cells proliferate slower than CD133(neg) cells.

  METHODS: Human prostate cancer cell lines were analyzed for CD133 expression and DNA content using flow cytometry. Rates of cell division and DNA synthesis were determined using CFSE cell tracing and BrdU uptake, respectively. Changes in cell cycle distribution and the percentage of CD133(pos) cells were assayed under conditions of different cell density and AR-pathway modulation. Lastly, we over-expressed lentiviral CD133 to measure whether CD133 regulates the cell cycle.

  RESULTS: The cell cycle distribution differs between CD133(pos) and CD133(neg) cells in all three human prostate cancer cell lines studied. CD133(pos) cells have a greater proportion of cells in G2 and proliferate faster than CD133(neg) cells. High cell density increases the percentage of CD133(pos) cells without changing CD133(pos) cell cycle progression. Treatment with the AR agonist R1881, or the anti-androgen MDV3100, significantly changed the percentage and proliferation of CD133(pos) cells. Finally, ectopic over-expression of CD133 had no effect on cell cycle progression.

  CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, we demonstrate that CD133(pos) cells proliferate faster than CD133(neg) cells. This association of CD133 expression with increased cell proliferation is not directly mediated by CD133, suggesting that surface CD133 is a downstream target gene of an undefined pathway controlling cell proliferation.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is a transmembrane cell surface peptidase present on prostatic epithelial cells that catalytically inactivates small peptide substrates. Neutral endopeptidase loss is associated with prostate cancer growth, progression, and increased angiogenesis. We examined whether NEP expression is regulated by hypoxia, frequently encountered in the tumor microenvironment.

  METHODS: NEP expression was compared in prostate cancer cell lines cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The NEP activity, protein levels, and mRNA levels were determined using enzyme assay, Western blotting and q-PCR analysis, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) was used to confirm the negative regulation of NEP at the transcriptional level by hypoxia responsive elements (HREs).

  RESULTS: The results indicate that NEP expression was inhibited under hypoxic conditions in the NEP positive LNCaP, C4-2, and 22RV1 cells and human umbilical vascular endothelial (HUVEC) cells. NEP regulation appeared to be predominantly at the transcriptional level as NEP mRNA expression significantly reduced with hypoxia, concordant with the kinetics of protein levels, and NEP enzyme activity. A search of the NEP gene sequence revealed three putative HREs upstream of the NEP promoter. Two of the HREs demonstrated a specific reduction of shift in the presence of cobalt chloride; specificity of the binding sites was confirmed by ChIP.

  CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a novel mechanism where hypoxia negatively regulates the tumor suppressor function of NEP in prostate cancer. The negative regulation of NEP is mediated by binding of the HIF1- protein binding to the HREs present upstream of the NEP promoter. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Low levels of selenium have been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa). Selenoprotein P is the most abundant selenoprotein in serum and delivers ten selenocysteine residues to tissues. Variation in the selenoprotein P gene (SEPP1) may influence PCa development or modify the effects of selenium. We examined the association of SEPP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with PCa risk and survival, and tested for interactions.

  METHODS: The Physicians' Health Study (PHS) is a prospective cohort of 22,071 US physicians; we utilized a nested case-control study of 1,352 PCa cases and 1,382 controls. We assessed four SNPs capturing common variation within the SEPP1 locus. In a subset of men (n = 80), we evaluated SEPP1 mRNA expression in tumors.

  RESULTS: Two SNPs were significantly associated with PCa risk. For rs11959466, each T allele increased risk (odds ratio (OR)= 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02,1.69; P(trend) = 0.03). For rs13168440, the rare homozygote genotype decreased risk compared to the common homozygote (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.96). Moreover, there was a significant interaction of rs13168440 with plasma selenium; increasing selenium levels were associated with decreased PCa risk only among men with the minor allele (P(interaction) = 0.01). SEPP1 expression was significantly lower in men with lethal PCa than long-term survivors.

  CONCLUSIONS: SEPP1 genetic variation was associated with PCa incidence; replication of these results in an independent dataset is necessary. These findings further support a causal link between selenium and PCa, and suggest that the effect of selenium may differ by genetics. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Delayed wound healing is considered one of the most serious diabetes-associated complications. The presence of replicating organisms such as bacteria within a diabetic's wound is considered one of the most important factors that impair cutaneous wound healing and the potential cellular and/or molecular mechanisms that are involved in the healing process. Defensins, which are anti-microbial peptides, have potent bactericidal activity against a wide spectrum of the bacterial and fungal organisms that are commonly responsible for wound infections. We recently demonstrated that camel whey proteins (WPs) expedite the healing of diabetic wounds by enhancing the immune response of wounded tissue cells and by alleviating some of the diabetic complications.

  METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effects of WP supplementation on the mRNA and protein expression levels of -defensin-1 (BD-1), 2 and 3 and subsequently on the wound healing process in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model. In this study, three groups of mice were used (10 mice per group): group 1, the non-diabetic mice (control); group 2, the diabetic mice; and group 3, the diabetic mice that received a daily supplement of undenatured WP (100 mg/kg of body weight) via oral gavage for 1 month.

  RESULTS: Compared with the non-diabetic control mice, the diabetic mice exhibited delayed wound closure that was characterized by a reduction in hydroxyproline content (indicator of collagen deposition), a marked elevation in free radical levels and a prolonged elevation in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-). Interestingly, compared with the diabetic mice that did not receive WP supplementation, the diabetic mice with WP had an accelerated closure and healing process of their wounds. The WP supplementation also decreased their levels of free radicals and restored their hydroxyproline content; proinflammatory cytokine levels; and expression of BD-1, 2 and 3 in the wounded tissue.

  CONCLUSION: WP supplementation may be beneficial for improving the healing and closure of diabetic wounds.

Abstract
  The understanding of radiotracer's physiological biodistribution as well as the potential source of false-positive results is crucial for an accurate diagnostic interpretation of (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT examination in patients with prostate cancer. We illustrate the results of whole-body (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT in a 79-year-old man with biochemical suspicion of prostate adenocarcinoma relapse. PET/CT study showed a focally increased (18)F-fluorocholine uptake, characterizing an incidentally found adrenocortical adenoma. Finally, we draw oncologists' attention to the possible false-positive results of (18)F-fluorocholine PET related to benign and unsuspected adrenocortical lesions in patients with a history of prostate malignancy.

Abstract
  Bone scintigraphy has been used extensively in prostate cancer patients to detect bone involvement. (11)C-choline PET/CT is indicated when a biochemical recurrence is suspected, as this procedure is able to detect local recurrence, lymph-node infiltration, and metastases.In cases where the results of these 2 procedures do not coincide, MRI is then usually performed. (18)F-fluoride may become an alternative to MRI for bone imaging.In our patient series, all bone lesions with (11)C-choline uptake were metastases. (18)F-Fluoride did not increase specificity of (11)C-choline but increased sensitivity of bone scintigraphy. CT helped in the interpretation of osteoarthritis and trauma lesions.

Abstract
  Modified butterfats (MBFs) were produced by lipase-catalyzed interesterification with 2 substrate blends (6:6:8 and 4:6:10, by weight) of anhydrous butterfat (ABF), palm stearin, and flaxseed oil in a stirred-batch type reactor after short path distillation. The 6:6:8 and 4:6:10 MBF contained 21.7% and 26.5%-linolenic acid, respectively. Total saturated fatty acids of the MBFs ranged from 41.4% to 47.4%. The cholesterol contents of the 6:6:8 and 4:6:10 MBFs were 21.0 and 12.1 mg/100 g, respectively. In addition, the melting points of the 6:6:8 and 4:6:10 MBFs were 32 C and 31 C, respectively. After preparation of recombined milks (oil-in-water emulsions) with MBFs, the stability of emulsions prepared with the MBFs (6:6:8 and 4:6:10) was compared to those with ABF during 10-d storage at 30 C. Skim milk powder (containing 1% protein) was added to prepare emulsions as an emulsifier. Microstructures of emulsions freshly prepared with the ABF and the MBFs consisted of uniform fat globules with no flocculation during 10-d storage. With respect to fat globule size distribution, the volume-surface mean droplet diameter (d(32)) of the 6:6:8 and 4:6:10 MBF emulsions ranged between 0.33 and 0.34 um, which was similar to the distribution in ABF emulsion. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Milk, an expensive dairy food, has been widely used in various milk-derived food products. Modified butterfats (MBFs) contain -linolenic acid as an essential fatty acid. Emulsion stability of recombined milks (oil-in-water emulsions) with MBFs was similar to that in anhydrous butterfat emulsion during 10-d storage. They may be a promising alternative for reconstituted milks to use in processed milk-based products.  2012 Institute of Food Technologists

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of (11)C-choline PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer (PC) after radical prostatectomy who presented with increasing PSA levels during follow-up in spite of being on hormone treatment (HT), and therefore showing HT resistance.

  METHODS: We evaluated a large series of 157 consecutive PC patients previously treated by radical prostatectomy who presented with biochemical recurrence with increasing PSA levels in spite of ongoing HT (HT-resistant patients). At the time of (11)C-choline PET/CT, the mean value of trigger PSA level was 8.3 (range 0.2 - 60.6 ng/mL), the mean PSA doubling time (PSAdt) was 5.3 (range 0.4 - 35 months), and the mean PSA velocity (PSAvel) was 22.1 ng/mL/year (range 0.12 - 82 ng/mL/year). (11)C-Choline PET/CT was performed following a standard procedure at our centre to investigate increasing PSA levels, either as the first imaging procedure or in patients with negative conventional imaging. At the time of (11)C-choline PET/CT all patients were receiving HT (61 were receiving monotherapy and 96 multidrug therapy). PET-positive findings were validated by: (a) transrectal US-guided biopsy in patients with recurrence in the prostatic bed, (b) surgical pelvic lymphadenectomy, (c) other imaging modalities, including repeated (11)C-choline PET/CT, performed during a minimum follow-up of 12-months.

  RESULTS: (11)C-Choline PET/CT showed positive findings in 104 of the 157 patients (66 %). (11)C-choline PET/CT detected: a single lesion in 40 patients (7 in the prostate bed, 10 in lymph nodes, 22 in bone, 1 at another site); two lesions in 18 patients (7 in lymph nodes, 7 in bone, 4 in both lymph nodes and bone); three or four lesions in 7 patients (4 in lymph nodes, 2 in bone, 1 at another site); and more than four lesions in the remaining 39 patients (2 in the prostate bed, 12 in lymph nodes, 12 in bone, 11 in both lymph nodes and bone, 2 at other sites). In (11)C-choline PET-negative patients, the mean values of trigger PSA, PSAdt and PSAvel were 3.8 ng/mL (range 0.2-11.9 ng/mL) 7.0 months (range 1.21 - 35 months) and 5.8 ng/mL/year (range 0.12 - 30.1) respectively, while in (11)C-Choline-PET-positive patients they were 10.5 ng/mL (range 0.2 - 60.6), 4.4 months (range 0.4 - 19.7) and 15.9 ng/mL/year (range 0.5 - 82.0) respectively. The differences between PET-negative and PET-positive patients were statistically significant for all these parameters: trigger PSA, p < 0.01; PSAdt, p < 0.01; PSAvel, p = 0.03.

  CONCLUSION: In our patient population, (11)C-choline PET/CT was able to detect relapsed disease in a large proportion of HT-resistant PC patients during HT. These data, obtained in a large series, suggest that HT withdrawal before performing a (11)C-choline PET/CT scan may not be necessary for the detection of recurrent disease if PSA levels are increasing and PSA kinetics are rapid.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The association of Ki-67 staining index (Ki67-SI) with overall survival (OS), disease-specific mortality (DSM), distant metastasis (DM), and biochemical failure (BF) was examined in men with favorable- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer receiving radiation therapy (RT) alone or with short-term androgen deprivation (ADT) in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 94-08.

  METHODS AND MATERIALS: 468 patients (23.6%) on RTOG 94-08 had sufficient tissue for Ki67-SI analysis. The median follow-up time was 7.9 years. Ki67-SI was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantified manually and by image analysis. Correlative analysis versus clinical outcome was performed using the third quartile (>=Q3) cutpoint. A proportional hazards multivariable analysis (MVA) dichotomized covariates in accordance with trial stratification and randomization criteria.

  RESULTS: In MVAs adjusted for all treatment covariates, high Ki67-SI (>=Q3) was correlated with increased DSM (hazard ratio [HR] 2.48, P=.03), DM (HR 3.5, P=.002), and BF (HR 3.55, P<.0001). MVA revealed similar Ki67-associated hazard ratios in each separate treatment arm for DSM, DM, and BF; these reached significance only for DM in the RT-alone arm and for BF in both arms. Ki67-SI was not a significant predictor of intraprostatic recurrence assessed by repeated biopsy 2 years after treatment. Patients with a high or low Ki67-SI seemed to experience a similar relative benefit from the addition of ADT to radiation.

  CONCLUSIONS: High Ki67-SI independently predicts for increased DSM, DM, and protocol BF in primarily intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with RT with or without ADT on RTOG 94-08 but does not predict for local recurrence or for increased relative benefit from ADT. This and prior studies lend support for the use of Ki67-SI as a stratification factor in future trials. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Constitutive activation of growth factor signaling pathways paradoxically triggers a cell cycle arrest known as cellular senescence. In primary cells expressing oncogenic ras, this mechanism effectively prevents cell transformation. Surprisingly, attenuation of ERK/MAP kinase signaling by genetic inactivation of Erk2, RNAi-mediated knockdown of ERK1 or ERK2, or MEK inhibitors prevented the activation of the senescence mechanism, allowing oncogenic ras to transform primary cells. Mechanistically, ERK-mediated senescence involved the proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins required for cell cycle progression, mitochondrial functions, cell migration, RNA metabolism, and cell signaling. This senescence-associated protein degradation (SAPD) was observed not only in cells expressing ectopic ras, but also in cells that senesced due to short telomeres. Individual RNAi-mediated inactivation of SAPD targets was sufficient to restore senescence in cells transformed by oncogenic ras or trigger senescence in normal cells. Conversely, the anti-senescence viral oncoproteins E1A, E6, and E7 prevented SAPD. In human prostate neoplasms, high levels of phosphorylated ERK were found in benign lesions, correlating with other senescence markers and low levels of STAT3, one of the SAPD targets. We thus identified a mechanism that links aberrant activation of growth signaling pathways and short telomeres to protein degradation and cellular senescence.

Abstract
  TGF- plays an important role in the progression of prostate cancer. It exhibits both tumor suppressor and tumor-promoting activities. Correlations between cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 overexpression and enhanced production of prostaglandin (PG)E2 have been implicated in cancer progression; however, there are no studies indicating that TGF- effects in prostate cancer cells involve PGE2 synthesis. In this study, we investigated TGF- regulation of COX-1 and COX-2 expression in prostate cancer cells and whether the effects of TGF- on cell proliferation and migration are mediated by PGE2. COX-1 protein was ubiquitously expressed in prostate cells; however, COX-2 protein levels were detected only in prostate cancer cells. TGF- treatment increased COX-2 protein levels and PGE2 secretion in PC3 cells. Exogenous PGE2 and PGF2 had no effects on cell proliferation in LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells whereas PGE2 and TGF- induced migration and invasive behavior in PC3 cells. Only EP2 and EP4 receptors were detected at mRNA levels in prostate cells. The EP4-targeting small interfering RNA inhibited PGE2 and TGF--induced migration of PC3 cells. TGF- and PGE2 induce activation of PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway as indicated by increased AKT, p70S6K, and S6 phosphorylation. Rapamycin completely blocked the effects of TGF- and PGE2 on phosphorylation of p70S6K and S6 but not on AKT phosphorylation. PGE2 and TGF- induced phosphorylation of AKT, which was blocked by antagonists of PGE2 (EP4) receptors (L161982, AH23848) and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) in PC3 cells. Pretreatment with L161982 or AH23848 blocked the stimulatory effects of PGE2 and TGF- on cell migration, whereas LY294002 or rapamycin completely eliminated PGE2, TGF-, and epidermal growth factor-induced migration in PC3 cells. We conclude that TGF- increases COX-2 levels and PGE2 secretion in prostate cancer cells which, in turn, mediate TGF- effects on cell migration and invasion through the activation of PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.

Abstract
  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a treatment for prostate cancer, is associated with bone loss and fractures. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-measured bone mineral density does not assess vertebral fractures (VF). High-resolution micro-magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) assesses bone microarchitecture and provides structural information. To determine if VF identification increased the diagnosis of osteoporosis beyond DXA and if HR-MRI demonstrated skeletal deterioration in men with VF, we cross-sectionally studied 137 men aged>=60 years with nonmetastatic prostate cancer on ADT for>=6 months. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) by DXA was confirmed with X-rays. HR-MRI of the wrist included bone volume to total volume (BV/TV), surface density (trabecular plates), surface/curve ratio (plates/rods), and erosion index (higher depicts deterioration). VF were found in 37% of men; the majority were unknown. Seven percent of participants were classified as osteoporotic by hip or spine DXA. Thirty-seven percent of men without osteoporosis by DXA had VF identified, suggesting that 90% of patients with clinical osteoporosis would have been misclassified by DXA alone. By ANOVA comparison across VF grades, the BV/TV, surface density, and spine, hip, and wrist DXA were lower, and erosion index was higher in men with moderate-severe VF compared with lesser grades (all p<0.05). By unadjusted ROC analysis, the addition of HR-MRI to DXA at the spine, hip, and femoral neck added substantially (AUC increased 0.831 to 0.902, p<0.05) to prediction of moderate-severe vertebral fracture. HR-MRI indices were associated with spine, hip, and wrist DXA measures (p<0.01). Longer duration of ADT was associated with lower BV/TV, surface density, and surface/curve ratio (p<0.05). ADT for men with prostate cancer is associated with silent VF. DXA alone leads to misclassifications of osteoporosis, which can be avoided by VF assessment. HR-MRI provides a novel technique to assess deterioration of structural integrity in men with VF and adds micro-structural information. Copyright  2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Abstract
  Qualitative and quantitative bone features were determined in nondecalcified and decalcified bone from 20 predetermined bone sites in each of 44 patients who died with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), some of which received bisphosphonate treatment (BP) in addition to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Thirty-nine of the 44 patients (89%) had evidence of bone metastases. By histomorphometric analysis, these bone metastases were associated with a range of bone responses from osteoblastic to osteolytic with a wide spectrum of bone responses often seen within an individual patient. Overall, the average bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) was 25.7%, confirming the characteristic association of an osteoblastic response to prostate cancer bone metastasis when compared with the normal age-matched weighted mean BV/TV of 14.7%. The observed new bone formation was essentially woven bone, and this was a localized event. In comparing BV/TV at metastatic sites between patients who had received BP treatment and those who had not, there was a significant difference (28.6% versus 19.3%, respectively). At bone sites that were not invaded by tumor, the average BV/TV was 10.1%, indicating significant bone loss owing to ADT that was not improved (11%) in those patients who had received BPs. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the number of osteoclasts present at the metastatic sites between patients treated or not treated with BPs, but in bone sites where the patient had been treated with BPs, giant osteoclasts were observed. Overall, 873 paraffin-embedded specimens and 661 methylmethacrylate-embedded specimens were analyzed. Our results indicate that in CRPC patients, ADT induces serious bone loss even in patients treated with BP. Furthermore, in this cohort of patients, BP treatment increased BV and did not decrease the number of osteoclasts in prostate cancer bone metastases compared with bone metastases from patients who did not receive BP.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of a 148-item quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) that was developed for the Barbados National Cancer Study (BNCS) to determine dietary intake over 12 months and examine the dietary risk factors.

  DESIGN: A cross-sectional validation study of the QFFQ against 4 d food diaries. Spearman's rank correlations (), intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and weighted k were computed as measures of concordance, adjusting for daily variations in the food diaries. Cross-classification tables and Bland-Altman plots were created for further assessment.

  SETTING: BNCS is a case-control study of environmental risk factors for breast and prostate cancer in a predominantly African-origin population in Barbados.

  SUBJECTS: Fifty-four individuals (21 years and older) were recruited among controls in the BNCS who were frequency-matched on sex and age group to breast and prostate cancer cases.

  RESULTS: Similar mean daily energy intake was derived from the food diary (8201 kJ (1960 kcal)) and QFFQ (7774 kJ (1858 kcal)). Rho for energy and macronutrients ranged from 0.66 (energy) to 0.17 (dietary fibre). The percentage of energy from carbohydrates and protein showed the highest and lowest ICC among macronutrients (0.63 and 0.27, respectively). The highest weighted k was observed for energy (0.45). When the nutrient intake was divided into quartiles, approximately 34 % of the observations were in the same quartile.

  CONCLUSIONS: This investigation supports the validity of the QFFQ as a method for assessing long-term dietary intake except for dietary fibre, folate, vitamins A, E and B12. The instrument will be a useful tool in the analysis of diet-cancer associations in the BNCS.

Abstract
  The consumption of foods containing resveratrol produces significant health benefits. Resveratrol inhibits cancer by reducing cell proliferation and metastasis and by inducing apoptosis. These actions could be explained by its ability to inhibit (ERK-1/2), Akt and suppressing the levels of estrogen and insulin growth factor -1 (IGF-1) receptor. How these processes are manifested into the antitumor actions of resveratrol is not clear. Using microarray studies, we show that resveratrol reduced the expression of various prostate-tumor associated microRNAs (miRs) including miR-21 in androgen-receptor negative and highly aggressive human prostate cancer cells, PC-3M-MM2. This effect of resveratrol was associated with reduced cell viability, migration and invasiveness. Additionally, resveratrol increased the expression of tumor suppressors, PDCD4 and maspin, which are negatively regulated by miR-21. Short interfering (si) RNA against PDCD4 attenuated resveratrol's effect on prostate cancer cells, and similar effects were observed following over expression of miR-21 with pre-miR-21 oligonucleotides. PC-3M-MM2 cells also exhibited high levels of phospho-Akt (pAkt), which were reduced by both resveratrol and LY294002 (a PI3-kinase inhibitor). MiR-21 expression in these cells appeared to be dependent on Akt, as LY294002 reduced the levels of miR-21 along with a concurrent increase in PDCD4 expression. These in vitro findings were further corroborated in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer. Oral administration of resveratrol not only inhibited the tumor growth but also decreased the incidence and number of metastatic lung lesions. These tumor- and metastatic-suppressive effects of resveratrol were associated with reduced miR-21 and pAkt, and elevated PDCD4 levels. Similar anti-tumor effects of resveratrol were observed in DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells which were associated with suppression of Akt and PDCD4, but independent of miR-21.These data suggest that resveratrol's anti-tumor actions in prostate cancer could be explained, in part, through inhibition of Akt/miR-21 signaling pathway.

Abstract
  The ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint functions in the maintenance of genetic stability and some missense variants of the ATM gene have been shown to confer a moderate increased risk of prostate cancer. However, whether inactivation of this checkpoint contributes directly to prostate specific cancer predisposition is still unknown. Here, we show that exposure of non-malignant prostate epithelial cells (HPr-1AR) to androgen led to activation of the ATM/ATR DNA damage response and induction of cellular senescence. Notably, knockdown of the ATM gene expression in HPr-1AR cells can promote androgen-induced TMPRSS2: ERG rearrangement, a prostate-specific chromosome translocation frequently found in prostate cancer cells. Intriguingly, unlike the non-malignant prostate epithelial cells, the ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint appears to be defective in prostate cancer cells, since androgen treatment only induced a partial activation of the DNA damage response. This mechanism appears to preserve androgen induced autophosphorylation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX, lesion processing and repair pathway yet restrain ATM/CHK1/CHK2 and p53 signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that ATM/ATR inactivation is a crucial step in promoting androgen-induced genomic instability and prostate carcinogenesis.

Abstract
  The analysis of exonic DNA from prostate cancers has identified recurrently mutated genes, but the spectrum of genome-wide alterations has not been profiled extensively in this disease. We sequenced the genomes of 57 prostate tumors and matched normal tissues to characterize somatic alterations and to study how they accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By modeling the genesis of genomic rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term "chromoplexy," frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis.

Abstract
  Vitamin D has broad range of physiological functions and antitumor effects. 24-Hydroxylase, encoded by the CYP24A1 gene, is the key enzyme for degrading many forms of vitamin D including the most active form, 1,25D(3). Inhibition of CYP24A1 enhances 1,25D(3) antitumor activity. To isolate regulators of CYP24A1 expression in prostate cancer cells, we established a stable prostate cancer cell line PC3 with CYP24A1 promoter driving luciferase expression to screen a small molecular library for compounds that inhibit CYP24A1 promoter activity. From this screening, we identified, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole (TBBz), a protein kinase CK2 selective inhibitor as a disruptor of CYP24A1 promoter activity. We show that TBBz inhibits CYP24A1 promoter activity induced by 1,25D(3) in prostate cancer cells. In addition, TBBz downregulates endogenous CYP24A1 mRNA level in TBBz-treated PC3 cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated CK2 knockdown reduces 1,25D(3)-induced CYP24A1 mRNA expression in PC3 cells. These results suggest that CK2 contributes to 1,25D(3)-mediated target gene expression. Finally, inhibition of CK2 by TBBz or CK2 siRNA significantly enhances 1,25D(3)-mediated antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model. In summary, our findings reveal that protein kinase CK2 is involved in the regulation of CYP24A1 expression by 1,25D(3) and CK2 inhibitor enhances 1,25D(3)-mediated antitumor effect. 2013 AACR.

Abstract
  Abnormalities in glycan biosynthesis have been conclusively linked to many diseases but the complexity of glycosylation has hindered the analysis of glycan data in order to identify glycoforms contributing to disease. To overcome this limitation, we developed a quantitative N-glycosylation model that interprets and integrates mass spectral and transcriptomic data by incorporating key glycosylation enzyme activities. Using the cancer progression model of androgen-dependent to androgen-independent Lymph Node Carcinoma of the Prostate (LNCaP) cells, the N-glycosylation model identified and quantified glycan structural details not typically derived from single-stage mass spectral or gene expression data. Differences between the cell types uncovered include increases in H(II) and Le(y) epitopes, corresponding to greater activity of 2-Fuc-transferase (FUT1) in the androgen-independent cells. The model further elucidated limitations in the two analytical platforms including a defect in the microarray for detecting the GnTV (MGAT5) enzyme. Our results demonstrate the potential of systems glycobiology tools for elucidating key glycan biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. The integration of multiple data sets represents an important application of systems biology for understanding complex cellular processes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Patients with chronic constipation due to food hypersensitivity (FH) had an elevated anal sphincter resting pressure. No studies have investigated a possible role of FH in anal fissures (AFs). We aimed to evaluate (1) the effectiveness of diet in curing AFs and to evaluate (2) the clinical effects of a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge, using cow's milk protein or wheat.

  METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one patients with AFs were randomized to receive a "true-elimination diet" or a "sham-elimination diet" for 8 weeks; both groups also received topical nifedipine and lidocaine. Sixty patients who were cured with the "true-elimination diet" underwent DBPC challenge in which cow's milk and wheat were used.

  RESULTS: At the end of the study, 69% of the "true-diet group" and 45% of the "sham-diet group" showed complete healing of AFs (P<0.0002). Thirteen of the 60 patients had AF recurrence during the 2-week cow's milk DBPC challenge and 7 patients had AF recurrence on wheat challenge. At the end of the challenge, anal sphincter resting pressure significantly increased in the patients who showed AF reappearance (P<0.0001), compared with the baseline values. The patients who reacted to the challenges had a significantly higher number of eosinophils in the lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocytes than those who did not react to the challenges.

  CONCLUSIONS: An oligo-antigenic diet combined with medical treatment improved the rate of chronic AF healing. In more than 20% of the patients receiving medical and dietary treatment, AFs recurred on DBPC food challenge.

Abstract
  Deletions involving the chromosomal band 5q21 are among the most frequent alterations in prostate cancer. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, we mapped a 1.3 megabase minimally deleted region including only the repulsive guidance molecule B (RGMB) and chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) genes. Functional analyses showed that CHD1 is an essential tumor suppressor. FISH analysis of 2,093 prostate cancers revealed a strong association between CHD1 deletion, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical failure (P = 0.0038), and absence of ERG fusion (P < 0.0001). We found that inactivation of CHD1 in vitro prevents formation of ERG rearrangements due to impairment of androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription, a prerequisite for ERG translocation. CHD1 is required for efficient recruitment of AR to responsive promoters and regulates expression of known AR-responsive tumor suppressor genes, including NKX3-1, FOXO1, and PPAR. Our study establishes CHD1 as the 5q21 tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer and shows a key role of this chromatin remodeling factor in prostate cancer biology.

Abstract
  Loss of E-cadherin is one of the key steps in tumor progression. Our previous studies demonstrate that SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) inhibited prostate cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between SPDEF and E-cadherin expression in an effort to better understand the mechanism of action of SPDEF in prostate tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The results presented here demonstrate a direct correlation between expression of E-cadherin and SPDEF in prostate cancer cells. Additional data demonstrate that modulation of E-cadherin and SPDEF had similar effects on cell migration/invasion. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of E-cadherin was sufficient to block the effects of SPDEF on cell migration and invasion. We also show that stable forced expression of SPDEF results in increased expression of E-cadherin, whereas down-regulation of SPDEF decreased E-cadherin expression. In addition, we demonstrate that SPDEF expression is not regulated by E-cadherin. Moreover, our chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay revealed that SPDEF occupies E-cadherin promoter site and acts as a direct transcriptional inducer of E-cadherin in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, to the best of our knowledge, these studies are the first demonstrating requirement of SPDEF for expression of E-cadherin, an essential epithelial cell junction protein. Given that loss of E-cadherin is a central tenant in tumor metastasis, the results of our studies, by providing a new mechanism for regulation of E-cadherin expression, could have far reaching impact.

Abstract
  Biomarker profiling, as a rapid screening approach for detection of hormone abuse, requires well selected candidate biomarkers and a thorough in vivo biomarker evaluation as previously done for detection of growth hormone doping in athletes. The bovine equivalent of growth hormone, called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) is (il)legally administered to enhance milk production in dairy cows. In this study, first a generic sample pre-treatment and 4-plex flow cytometric immunoassay (FCIA) were developed for simultaneous measurement of four candidate biomarkers selected from literature: insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), its binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), osteocalcin and endogenously produced antibodies against rbST. Next, bovine serum samples from two extensive controlled rbST animal treatment studies were used for in vivo validation and biomarker evaluation. Finally, advanced statistic tools were tested for the assessment of biomarker combination quality aiming to correctly identify rbST-treated animals. The statistical prediction tool k-nearest neighbours using a combination of the biomarkers osteocalcin and endogenously produced antibodies against rbST proved to be very reliable and correctly predicted 95% of the treated samples starting from the second rbST injection until the end of the treatment period and even thereafter. With the same biomarker combination, only 12% of untreated animals appeared false-positive. This reliability meets the requirements of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC for screening methods in veterinary control. From the results of this multidisciplinary study, it is concluded that the osteocalcin - anti-rbST-antibodies combination represent fit-for-purpose biomarkers for screening of rbST abuse in dairy cattle and can be reliably measured in both the developed 4-plex FCIA as well as in a cost-effective 2-plex microsphere-based binding assay. This screening method can be incorporated in routine veterinary monitoring programmes: in the European Union for detection of rbST abuse and in the control of rbST-free dairy farms in the United States of America and other countries.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends nutritionally adequate complementary feeding (CF) through the introduction of indigenous foodstuffs and local foods while breastfeeding for at least 2 years. To determine the adequacy of the contribution of CF to the diets of Guatemalan infants at the 7th-12th month of life receiving high-intensity continued breastfeeding.

  SUBJECTS/METHODS: Critical nutrient densities for CF were modelled using age- and sex-specific energy and protein requirements assuming children to be at the 50th weight percentile of local peers and 15th weight percentiles of the 2006 WHO standards. Nutrient requirements for the total diet were determined using the recommended nutrient intakes. Breast milk was assumed to provide 75% of total energy at the 7th-9th month and 50% at the 10th-12th month. Gaps between computed critical nutrient densities and the CF consumption of 128 Guatemalan infants based on data collected by means of three nonconsecutive 24-h quantitative intake recalls were examined. Locally consumed foods with nutrient densities above the modelled critical densities were identified.

  RESULTS: Observed non-breast milk complementation would result in total diets providing inadequate nutrient density for vitamin A, niacin and vitamin C in some age groups. Major gaps for calcium, iron and zinc were ubiquitous across all groups. Few foods commonly consumed among Guatemalan infants had adequate densities of 'problem nutrients'.

  CONCLUSIONS: The critical nutrient density concept is useful to evaluate the nutrient adequacy of the infant's diet. Fortified foods are essential sources of the main 'problem nutrients', namely calcium, iron and zinc, given that natural sources are scarce.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the downregulated expression of the prostate androgen regulated (PAR) gene on the cell cycle and apoptosis of PC3 cells as well as on the expression level of Bcl-2/Bax.

  METHODS: After transfecting PC3 cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PAR, we detected the inhibitory effect of PAR depletion on the proliferation of the PC3 cells by MTT assay, determined their apoptosis by flow cytometry, and measured the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax by Western blot.

  RESULTS: The expression of PAR was suppressed by siRNA, the G2-M phase PC3 cells were increased to (29.95 +/- 3.25)%, and the apoptosis of the cells was enhanced to (20.61 +/- 2.73)%, with statistically significant difference from the control group (P < 0.01). Western blot showed a decreased expression of Bcl-2, an increased expression of Bax, and an elevated ratio of Bax to Bcl-2.

  CONCLUSION: Downregulation of the PAR expression increases the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Bax expression, and thus induces the G2-M phase arrest and apoptosis of PC3 cells.

Abstract
  SIRT1 (mammalian ortholog of the yeast silent information regulator 2) is a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase belonging to the multigene family of sirtuins. Anecdotal and epidemiologic observations provide evidence for beneficial effects of the calorie restriction mimetic resveratrol (RES), a SIRT1 activator in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Although SIRT1 possesses both tumorigenic and antitumorigenic potential, the molecular mechanisms underlying SIRT1-mediated tumor progression or inhibition are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of SIRT1 in multiple human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate-specific PTEN knockout mouse model using resveratrol. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (C42B, PC3, and DU145) express higher levels of SIRT1 than androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and nontumorigenic prostate cells (RWPE-1). Resveratrol enhanced this expression without any significant effect on SIRT1 enzymatic activity. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression using shRNA enhanced cell proliferation and inhibited autophagy by repressing phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. These biologic correlates were reversed in the presence of resveratrol. Analysis of prostates from dietary intervention with resveratrol showed a significant reduction in prostate weight and reduction in the incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic (HGPIN) lesions by approximately 54% with no significant change in body weight. Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1. These data suggest that SIRT1/S6K-mediated inhibition of autophagy drives prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore, modulation of SIRT1/S6K signaling represents an effective strategy for prostate cancer prevention. 2012 AACR.

Abstract
  Herein, employing anatomical and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we evaluated noninvasively, the in vivo, chemopreventive efficacy of inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), a major constituent of high-fiber diets, against prostate tumor growth and progression in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Male TRAMP mice, beginning at 4 weeks of age, were fed with 1%, 2%, or 4% (w/v) IP6 in drinking water or only drinking water till 28 weeks of age and monitored using MRI over the course of study. Longitudinal assessment of prostate volumes by conventional MRI and tumor vascularity by gadolinium-based DCE-MRI showed a profound reduction in tumor size, partly due to antiangiogenic effects by IP6 treatment. As potential mechanisms of IP6 efficacy, decrease in the expression of glucose transporter GLUT-4 protein together with an increase in levels of phospho-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK(Th172)) were observed in prostate tissues of mice from IP6 fed-groups, suggesting that IP6 is interfering with the metabolic events occurring in TRAMP prostate. Investigative metabolomics study using quantitative high-resolution (1)H-NMR on prostate tissue extracts showed that IP6 significantly decreased glucose metabolism and membrane phospholipid synthesis, in addition to causing an increase in myoinositol levels in the prostate. Together, these findings show that oral IP6 supplement blocks growth and angiogenesis of prostate cancer in the TRAMP model in conjunction with metabolic events involved in tumor sustenance. This results in energy deprivation within the tumor, suggesting a practical and translational potential of IP6 treatment in suppressing growth and progression of prostate cancer in humans. 2012 AACR.

Abstract
  Current protocols for the screening of prostate cancer cannot accurately discriminate clinically indolent tumors from more aggressive ones. One reliable indicator of outcome has been the determination of organ-confined versus nonorgan-confined disease but even this determination is often only made following prostatectomy. This underscores the need to explore alternate avenues to enhance outcome prediction of prostate cancer patients. Fluids that are proximal to the prostate, such as expressed prostatic secretions (EPS), are attractive sources of potential prostate cancer biomarkers as these fluids likely bathe the tumor. Direct-EPS samples from 16 individuals with extracapsular (n = 8) or organ-confined (n = 8) prostate cancer were used as a discovery cohort, and were analyzed in duplicate by a nine-step MudPIT on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. A total of 624 unique proteins were identified by at least two unique peptides with a 0.2% false discovery rate. A semiquantitative spectral counting algorithm identified 133 significantly differentially expressed proteins in the discovery cohort. Integrative data mining prioritized 14 candidates, including two known prostate cancer biomarkers: prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase, which were significantly elevated in the direct-EPS from the organ-confined cancer group. These and five other candidates (SFN, MME, PARK7, TIMP1, and TGM4) were verified by Western blotting in an independent set of direct-EPS from patients with biochemically recurrent disease (n = 5) versus patients with no evidence of recurrence upon follow-up (n = 10). Lastly, we performed proof-of-concept SRM-MS-based relative quantification of the five candidates using unpurified heavy isotope-labeled synthetic peptides spiked into pools of EPS-urines from men with extracapsular and organ-confined prostate tumors. This study represents the first efforts to define the direct-EPS proteome from two major subclasses of prostate cancer using shotgun proteomics and verification in EPS-urine by SRM-MS.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to elucidate the mechanism of high bone turnover during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in terms of osteogenic endocrine activity by testosterone, adrenal androgens, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), and to identify markers reflecting the bone mineral density (BMD) during ADT.

  DESIGN: BMD and samples of blood and urine were studied before and after 6months of ADT in 70 patients with localized prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: Before ADT, serum free-testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, and IGF-I levels were correlated with BMD (rs=0.344, p=0.004; rs=0.264, p=0.027; rs=0.329, p=0.005; rs=0.300, p=0.012, respectively). The serum IGF-I level was independently correlated with the pretreatment BMD (Multivariate p=0.001). These relationships disappeared after ADT (p=0.519, 0.316, 0.116, and 0.597, respectively). After ADT, serum levels of free-testosterone decreased (7.9 to 0.2pg/mL), and DHEA-S and androstenedione were also reduced (3.6 to 2.3umol/L and 5.6 to 2.9nmol/L, respectively) (p<0.001 in all). In contrast, IGF-I levels were elevated after ADT by 11.6% (19.9 to 22.3nmol/L, p<0.001). Delta-values of IGF-I (post- minus pretreatment levels, mean: +2.2, ranged between -7.1 and +15.3) were inversely correlated with the pretreatment (rs=-0.333 p=0.005) and post-treatment (rs=-0.408, p=0.001) BMD. After ADT, the serum IGF-I level was closely correlated with the serum level of the bone formation marker bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (rs=0.328, p=0.006), and delta-IGF-I and delta-BAP showed a close positive correlation (rs=0.388, p=0.001). The post-treatment BMD was correlated only with the urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD) concentration (rs=-0.302, p=0.024) among the bone formation/resorption markers including serum/urine N-telopeptide.

  CONCLUSIONS: Serum IGF-I levels increased during ADT in men with a low BMD. Coupled with reduced androgen levels, elevated IGF-I levels, which were positively correlated with BAP during ADT, possibly explain the mechanism of ADT-related high bone turnover. The increase of IGF-I is more prominent in men whose BMD is already low at the baseline, and urine DPD might be a marker that reflects BMD during ADT. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of protein kinase D3 (PKD3) in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 7 (MMP-7) expression in prostate cancer cells.

  METHODS: PC-3 cells were either stimulated with 100 nmol/L PMA to activate PKD3 kinase activity, or transiently transfected with PKD3 siRNA, and the relative expression level of MMP-7 mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR using 2(-delta delta Ct) method. MMP-7 mRNA levels were also analyzed and quantified in HEK293 cells with over-expression of wild-type PKD3, PKD3 knockdown (using PKD3 siRNA), or over-expression of wild-type PKD3 followed by PKD3 knockdown.

  RESULTS: MMP-7 mRNA expression in PC3 cells was significantly decreased after PMA-induced PKD3 kinase activation. In contrast, PKD3 knockdown by siRNA transfection markedly increased MMP-7 mRNA level (P<0.01). MMP-7 mRNA level in HEK293 cells was significantly decreased by PKD3 over-expression, whereas obviously increased by PKD3 knockdown. Down-regulation of MMP-7 mRNA level in HEK293 induced by PKD3 over-expression was rescued by PKD3 knockdown.

  CONCLUSION: PKD3 may contribute to the malignant progression of prostate cancer cells through negative regulation of MMP-7 expression.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the functional and oncologic outcomes of patients with locally advanced or lymph node metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) treated by laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) in a single Chinese institution.

  METHODS: From June 2004 to June 2011, a total of 152 cases including 105 locally advanced PCa and 47 lymph node metastatic PCa who were treated by LRP with extended lymph node dissection (ePLND) were enrolled in this study. Surgical records, urinary continence, complications, and oncologic outcomes were presented.

  RESULTS: The mean operation time and bleeding were 240 min and 110 ml, respectively. After 12-87 months (median 48 m) of follow-up, 91.4 and 94.7 % of the patients were urinary continence at 6 and 12 m, respectively. Eighty biochemical recurrent diseases were observed. The 3- and 5-year biochemical progression-free survival rates were 59.2 and 47.3 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that Gleason score (HR: 1.66, 95 % CI: 1.05-2.64, P = 0.031), pathological stage (HR: 1.64, 95 % CI: 1.2-2.23, P = 0.002), and surgical margin status (HR: 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.04-2.95, P = 0.035) were independent predictive factors for subsequent biochemical relapse. The 3- and 5-year overall and cancer-specific survival rates were 90.2, 86.0 and 95.8, 92.3 %, respectively. There were no significant differences in biochemical recurrence-free (42.6 vs. 49.5 %, P = 0.491), overall (83.4 vs. 87.3 % P = 0.503), and cancer-specific survival rates (92.3 vs. 94.9 %, P = 0.801) between lymph node-positive and -negative PCa.

  CONCLUSION: With favorable functional and oncologic outcomes in this cohort of 152 patients, we concluded that LRP plus ePLND is feasible for patients with locally advanced non-extra node metastatic PCa.

Abstract
  The present study examines the resistance of the -lactalbumin to -chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) digestion under various experimental conditions. Whey protein isolate (WPI) was hydrolysed using randomised hydrolysis conditions (5 and 10% of WPI; pH 7.0, 7.8 and 8.5; temperature 25, 37 and 50 C; enzyme-to-substrate ratio, E/S, of 0.1%, 0.5 and 1%). Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to analyse residual proteins. Heat, pH adjustment and two inhibitors (Bowman-Birk inhibitor and trypsin inhibitor from chicken egg white) were used to stop the enzyme reaction. While operating outside of the enzyme optimum it was observed that at pH 8.5 selective hydrolysis of -lactoglobulin was improved because of a dimer-to-monomer transition while -la remained relatively resistant. The best conditions for the recovery of native and pure -la were at 25 C, pH 8.5, 1% E/S ratio, 5% WPI (w/v) while the enzyme was inhibited using Bowman-Birk inhibitor with around 81% of original -la in WPI was recovered with no more -lg. Operating conditions for hydrolysis away from the chymotrypsin optimum conditions offers a great potential for selective WPI hydrolysis, and removal, of -lg with production of whey protein concentrates containing low or no -lg and pure native -la. This method also offers the possibility for production of -lg-depleted milk products for sensitive populations.

Abstract
  The aim of the study was to identify the species of Enterobacteriaceae present in Montasio cheese and to assess their potential to produce biogenic amines. Plate count methods and an Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) approach, combined with 16S rDNA sequencing, were used to investigate the Enterobacteriaceae community present during the cheesemaking and ripening of 6 batches of Montasio cheese. Additionally, the potential decarboxylation abilities of selected bacterial isolates were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed against tyrosine, histidine, ornithine and lysine. The most predominant species detected during cheese manufacturing and ripening were Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Hafnia alvei. The non-limiting physico-chemical conditions (pH, NaCl% and a(w)) during ripening were probably the cause of the presence of detectable levels of Enterobacteriaceae up to 120 d of ripening. The HPLC test showed that cadaverine and putrescine were the amines produced in higher amounts by almost all isolates, indicating that the presence of these amines in cheese can be linked to the presence of high counts of Enterobacteriaceae. 44 isolates produced low amounts of histamine (<300 ppm), and four isolates produced more than 1000 ppm of this amine. Only 9 isolates, belonging to the species Citrobacter freundii, Esch. coli and Raoultella ornithinolytica, appeared to produce tyramine. These data provided new information regarding the decarboxylase activity of some Enterobacteriaceae species, including Pantoea agglomerans, Esch. fergusonii and R. ornithinolytica.

Abstract
  Kefir is a fermented-milk beverage originating and widely consumed in the Caucasus as well as in Eastern Europe and is a source of bacteria with potential probiotic properties. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli producing Shiga toxin is commonly associated with food-transmitted diseases; the most prevalent serotype causing epidemics is Esch. coli O157:H7. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonism of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir against the action on Vero cells of supernatants of the Esch. coli O157:H7 strain 69160 expressing the type-II Shiga toxin (Stx2) and to study the role of the Lactobacillus cell wall in that inhibition. Spent culture supernatants of Esch. coli O157:H7 strain 69160 led to cytotoxic effects on cultured eukaryotic cells as evidenced by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide-cleavage assay or by lactate-dehyrogenase release. Lb. plantarum CIDCA 83114 reduced the cytotoxic activity of Stx present in strain-69160 supernatants, and this protection was markedly higher than those of Lactobacillus kefir CIDCA 83113 and 8348 and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CIDCA 333. This antagonism of cytotoxicity was mimicked by Lb. plantarum cell walls but was reduced after heating or protease treatments, thus indicating a protein or peptide as being involved in the protection mechanism. The cell surface of the lactobacilli bound the subunit B of Stx thereby decreasing the cytotoxicity. These interactions could constitute the first step in preventing the damage induced by Esch. coli O157:H7 supernatants, thus representing a valuable means of potentially mitigating the noxious effects of this food pathogen.

Abstract
  Caseinomacropeptide (CMP), a 7-kDa phosphoglycopolypeptide fragment released from k-casein during milk renneting, is heterogeneous with respect to post-translational glycosylation. Several studies have reported that CMP has growth-promoting activity on lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of glycosylation and sequence variations between bovine and caprine CMP on the growth of two probiotics: Lactobacillus rhamnosus RW-9595-M and Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67. The growth-promoting activities of CMP (mixture of glycosylated (gCMP) and non-glycosylated (aCMP) fractions), aCMP and gCMP were measured in a basal minimal culture medium using turbidimetric microplate assay at 37 C. Supplementation of the culture media at 2 mg/ml significantly improved maximum growth by 1.5 to 1.8 times depending on the strain, the additive (CMP, aCMP, gCMP), and the bovine or caprine origin (P < 0.05). CMP preparations also decreased the time needed to reach the inflexion point of the growth curve and increase the cell density at that time (P < 0.05). The effects of CMP preparations were dose dependent and significantly superior to the effect of bovine -lactoglobulin added to the culture media. As gCMP and aCMP were as efficient as bovine and caprine CMP (P > 0.1), it was concluded that the presence of oligosaccharides linked to CMP was not essential for growth-promoting activity of CMP.

Abstract
  The shortcomings of Staphylococcus aureus vaccines to control bovine mastitis have been attributed to insufficient capacity of the vaccines to induce opsonizing antibodies and to stimulate cellular immune responses. Types of antigen, administration route and adjuvant used in a vaccine formulation have been identified as critical factors for the development of opsonic antibodies. Current commercially available vaccines for Staph. aureus bovine mastitis control are formulated with Al(OH)3 and oil-based adjuvants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune response of heifers immunized with a Staph. aureus CP5 whole cell vaccine formulated either with Al(OH)3 or ISCOMATRIXTM. Twenty primigravid Holstein dairy heifers in the last trimester of gestation were immunized either with a vaccine formulated with ISCOMATRIXTM (n = 6), Al(OH)3 (n = 7), or saline solution (placebo) (n = 7). Immunization was carried out 38 and 10 d before calving. Heifers vaccinated with Staph. aureus adjuvanted with ISCOMATRIXTM responded with significantly higher levels of anti-bacterin and anti-CP5 IgG and IgG2 in sera than animals in the Al(OH)3 or control groups. Animals in the ISCOMATRIXTM group responded with significantly higher anti-bacterin specific IgG in whey than animals in the Al(OH)3 and control groups, detected from the first week post calving until 60 d of lactation. Sera from animals inoculated with Staph. aureus in ISCOMATRIXTM, obtained 7 d post partum, significantly increased both the number of neutrophils ingesting bacteria and the number of bacteria being ingested by the neutrophils, compared with sera obtained from heifers vaccinated with Al(OH)3 or non-vaccinated controls. These features coupled to safety of the ISCOMATRIXTM formulation, warrant additional studies.

Abstract
  The aim of this study was to assess the effect of chemical composition, coagulation properties, pH, and titratable acidity (TA, SH/50 ml) of vat milk on Grana Padano cheese yield (CY) under field conditions. Twelve cheese-making sessions were carried out from February to December 2009 in a dairy cooperative of Grana Padano Consortium (Italy), for a total of 96 vats of milk processed. For each vat, samples of raw milk were collected and analysed for quality traits (fat, protein, and casein contents), pH, TA, and milk coagulation properties (MCP), measured as rennet coagulation time (RCT, min), curd-firming time (k(20), min), and curd firmness (a(30), mm). Cheese yield was expressed as kilograms of cheese per 100 kg milk transformed, and was measured after 2 d of drainage. Fat, protein, and casein contents were positively and strongly correlated with CY (coefficients of correlation, r = 0.72, 0.88, and 0.84, respectively; P < 0.001). Coagulation properties were moderately and significantly (P < 0.001) related to CY: milk that coagulated earlier and had stronger a(30) was associated to greater CY. Cheese yield was analysed with a model that accounted for fixed effects of cheese-making day, fat and protein content, TA, and a(30). Significance was found for all the effects (P < 0.05). Milk characterised by high values of a(30) resulted in higher CY than milk with low values of a 30, indicating that MCP could be used as indicators of cheese-making efficiency. Future research should investigate the relationships between MCP and quality of cheese, and explore the feasibility of including MCP in multiple component milk pricing system for Grana Padano cheese production.

Abstract
  This chapter addresses issues relevant to prostate cancer overdiagnosis. Factors promoting the overdiagnosis of prostate cancer are reviewed. First is the existence of a relatively large, silent reservoir of this disease, as can be seen by evaluating autopsy studies and histologic step-sectioning results of prostates removed for other causes. The second main factor responsible for prostate cancer overdiagnosis is fairly widespread prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal examination-based screening, which has been fairly widely practiced in the United States for the past 20 years among heterogeneous groups of men. This has resulted in the identification of many men from this reservoir who otherwise may never have been diagnosed with symptomatic prostate cancer and is substantially responsible for the current annual incidence to mortality ratio for prostate cancer of approximately 6 to 1. Finally, the relatively indolent natural history and limited cancer-specific mortality as reported in a variety of contemporary randomized screening and treatment trials is reviewed. We attempt to quantitate the proportion of newly diagnosed prostate cancers that are overdiagnosed using various trial results and models. We explore the impact of prostate cancer overdiagnosis in terms of patient anxiety and the potential for overtreatment, with its attendant morbidity. We explore strategies to minimize overdiagnosis by targeting screening and biopsy only to men at high risk for aggressive prostate cancer and by considering the use of agents such as 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Future prospects to prevent overtreatment, including better biopsy and molecular characterization of newly diagnosed cancer and the role of active surveillance, are discussed.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The severe iatrogenic hypogonadal state induced by medical castration used for treatment of prostate cancer is associated with adverse effects including fatigue, increased fracture risk, and a decrease in skeletal muscle function, which negatively impact quality of life. We have previously reported beneficial changes in healthy lifestyle behaviors, physical function and fatigue as a result of a novel combined exercise and dietary advice intervention (a lifestyle intervention) in men with prostate cancer on androgen suppression therapy (AST). The aim of this research was to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the lifestyle intervention in these men with advanced prostate cancer receiving androgen suppression therapy (AST).

  METHODS: Twelve men with prostate cancer on AST took part in three focus groups in a UK higher education institution following the 12 week intervention. Sessions lasted between 45 and 60 minutes in duration. All discussions were audio-taped and transcribed. A framework analysis approach was applied to the focus group data. An initial coding framework was developed from a priori issues listed in the topic guide and extended and refined following initial familiarization with the focus group transcripts. Line by line indexing of the transcripts was undertaken iteratively to allow for the incorporation of new codes. Coded sections of text were grouped together (charted) into themes and subthemes prior to a further process of comparison and interpretation.

  RESULTS: None of the participants involved in the trial were provided with information on how lifestyle changes might be beneficial to men with prostate cancer during the course of their standard medical treatment. We present novel findings that this intervention was considered beneficial for reducing anxiety around treatment and fear of disease progression. Men were supportive of the benefits of the intervention over conventional cancer survival discussion group arrangements as it facilitated peer support in addition to physical rehabilitation.

  CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of lifestyle changes in men with prostate cancer are not well appreciated by care providers despite a range of benefits becoming apparent. Strategies to implement exercise and dietary interventions in standard care should be further evaluated.

Abstract
  Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for ERG is used as a surrogate for TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, a specific molecular event seen in ~50% of prostate carcinomas (PCas) and ~20% of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) intermingled with adjacent PCa demonstrating identical gene fusions. We studied 84 "atypical glands suspicious for cancer (ATYP)" cases using multiplex ERG/-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (AMACR)/high-molecular-weight cytokeratin/p63 IHC to determine how often ERG contributes to resolving an ATYP diagnosis beyond that provided by AMACR and basal markers. Final diagnoses of benign, ATYP, and cancer were rendered after review of morphology and all markers in 3, 30, and 51 cases, respectively. Of 51 cancer diagnoses, 45% and 94% were positive for ERG and AMACR, respectively. Of 30 atypical diagnoses, 10% and 67% were positive for ERG and AMACR, respectively. Of 3 benign diagnoses, none and 83% were positive for ERG and AMACR, respectively. Three ERG-positive atypical cases were classified as "HGPIN with adjacent ATYP." ERG was expressed in adjacent noncancer glands of 20% of PCas, whereas AMACR was expressed in noncancer glands in all diagnostic categories in 40% of cases. Positive ERG staining helped establish the initial ATYP diagnosis to PCa in 28% cases whose diagnoses would otherwise remain ATYP based on AMACR and basal markers. ERG positivity in small atypical glands where HGPIN diagnosis is excluded helps establish a definitive cancer diagnosis in a small proportion of additional ATYP cases. We recommend judicious use of ERG, preferably as a component of multiplex IHC, in evaluation of difficult prostate biopsies. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Human aurora kinases are three highly conserved serine/threonine kinases with regulatory function in chromosome alignment, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis during cell cycle progression and their overexpression associates with malignant transformation and proliferation of cancer cells. Aurora genes are located at loci that are commonly altered in cancers. Aurora-A has oncogenic activity while Aurora-B does not. Aurora-C is only detected in mammals with involvement in meiosis. Oncogenic activity of Aurora-C is still in dispute. We evaluated the expression of three Aurora kinases by real-time RT-PCR in well-known breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Cell cycle was studied with flow cytometry. In both more invasive cell lines' p53-null cells, PC-3 and MDA-MB-231, an increase in mRNA expression of three Aurora kinases, especially Aurora-C, was observed. Genomic DNA was examined for gene amplification and aneuploidy as a mechanism of overexpression. At DNA level, only Aurora-C showed gene amplification in breast cancer cell lines (p < 0.005). Here we provide evidence for the first time of Aurora-C overexpression and gene amplification.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is one of the cheapest, safest and widely used over-the-counter-drugs in Thailand. Here the authors examine the antimetastatic potential of NAC on the metastasis of human prostate cancer cells.

  MATERIAL AND METHOD: Cytotoxicity of NAC to human prostate cancer cells, DU145 and PC3, were determined by proliferation assay using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol, 2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by using a chemotaxis chamber containing membrane pre-coated with collagen IV and Matrigel, respectively. Cell attachment onto the surface of the membrane coated with collagen IV was tested for its adhesion potentiality.

  RESULTS: NAC could inhibit the growth of DU145 and PC3 cells. Suppression of migration and invasion of both human prostrate cancer cells were observed. Cell attachment to the collagen IV-coated surface was obviously reduced. All inhibitions occurred in a dose-dependent fashion in both cell lines.

  CONCLUSION: NAC could have a high potential in attenuating the migration of the human prostate cancer cells from their primary site and their adhesion and invasion to the remote locations. Hence, NAC might suppress the growth of the primary and the secondary tumors. Our findings suggest that NAC had a high possibility to become an antimetastatic agent for testing in clinical trials. Then, NAC might be used clinically as an optional adjuvant therapeutic drug in addition to the conventional standard treatment of human prostate cancer, obtaining a better outcome with the least toxic and affordable substance.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: Prostate cancer is an ideal target for chemoprevention. To date, chemoprevention clinical trials with 5-reductase inhibitors have yielded encouraging yet ultimately confounding results. Using a preclinical mouse model of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) induced by PTEN loss, we observed unprecedented deteriorating effects of androgen deprivation, in which surgical castration or MDV3100 treatment accelerated disease progression of the otherwise stable HG-PIN to invasive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). As an alternative, targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway via either genetic ablation of genes encoding PI3K components or pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K pathway reversed the PTEN loss-induced HG-PIN phenotype. Finally, concurrent inhibition of the PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways was effective in blocking the growth of PTEN-null CRPC. Together, these data have revealed the potential adverse effects of antiandrogen chemoprevention in certain genetic contexts (such as PTEN loss) while showing the promise of targeted therapy in the clinical management of this complex and prevalent disease.

  SIGNIFICANCE: Chemoprevention with antiandrogen therapies is attractive for prostate cancer, given its prevalence and established hormonally mediated pathogenesis. However, because PTEN loss has been found in 9% to 45% of HG-PIN in the clinic, the current findings suggest that patients with PTEN-deficient prostate tumors might be better treated with PI3K-targeted therapies.

Abstract
  Phosphorylation of proteins is an important cellular regulatory process. The analysis of protein phosphorylation is challenging due to the high dynamic range and low abundance natures of phosphorylated species. Mass spectrometry (MS) of phosphopeptides obtained from tryptic protein digests is the method-of-choice for characterization of phosphorylated proteins. However, determination of phosphopeptides by MS represents a major challenge, especially in the presence of unmodified peptides. Due to lower ionization efficiency of phosphopeptides, as well as the fact that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation is often present at low relative abundance, efficient enrichment of the phosphorylated peptides prior to MS analysis is therefore of high demand. In addition, successful identification of peptides with different phosphorylation grades still remains challenging. This work presents a new strategy for enrichment and subsequent selective elution of multi-, mono- and nonphosphorylated peptides based on their difference in pI by using pH gradient elution in presence of different concentration of acetonitrile prior to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-MS). The developed protocol was successfully applied for -casein tryptic digest and bovine serum albumin digest spiked with 9 synthetic phosphopeptides. Further selectivity for phosphopeptides was demonstrated by fractionation of peptides from a milk digest. Copyright  2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Ultrasound stimulated microbubbles (USMB) are being investigated for their potential to promote the uptake of anticancer agents into tumor tissue by exploiting their ability to enhance microvascular permeability. At sufficiently high ultrasound transmit amplitudes it has also recently been shown that USMB treatments can, on their own, induce vascular damage, shutdown blood flow, and inhibit tumor growth. The objective of this study is to examine the antitumor effects of 'antivascular' USMB treatments in conjunction with chemotherapy, which differs from previous work which has sought to enhance drug uptake with USMBs by increasing vascular permeability. Conceptually this is a strategy similar to combining vascular disrupting agents with a chemotherapy, and we have selected the taxane docetaxel (Taxotere) for evaluating this approach as it has previously been shown to have potent antitumor effects when combined with small molecule vascular disrupting agents. Experiments were conducted on PC3 tumors implanted in athymic mice. USMB treatments were performed at a frequency of 1 MHz employing sequences of 50 ms bursts (0.00024 duty cycle) at 1.65 MPa. USMB treatments were administered on a weekly basis for 4 weeks with docetaxel (DTX) being given intravenously at a dose level of 5 mg/kg. The USMB treatments, either alone or in combination with DTX, induced an acute reduction in tumor perfusion which was accompanied at the 24 hour point by significantly enhanced necrosis and apoptosis. Longitudinal experiments showed a modest prolongation in survival but no significant growth inhibition occurred in DTX-only and USMB-only treatment groups relative to control tumors. The combined USMB-DTX treatment group produced tumor shrinkage in weeks 4-6, and significant growth inhibition and survival prolongation relative to the control (p<0.001), USMB-only (p<0.01) and DTX-only treatment groups (p<0.01). These results suggest the potential of enhancing the antitumor activity of docetaxel by combining it with antivascular USMB effects.

Abstract
  Androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) is difficult to treat. Present study is to explore the inhibitory effect of a cytokine environment on AIPC and its mechanism. We utilized nerve growth factor (NGF)/-interferon (-IFN) to change the cytokine environment. Animal models and 2 androgen receptor (AR)-negative prostate cancer cell lines were used to evaluate the effect of NGF/-IFN. Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, western blotting, Tunel assay, colony formation efficiency, gene microarray, and in vivo bioluminescence were used to discern the mechanisms within NGF/-IFN that effect the environment. In vitro, NGF/-IFN effectively inhibited the proliferation of AIPC cell lines and promoted the apoptosis of the cancer cells. In vivo, NGF/-IFN suppressed the growth and metastasis of a tumor mass that arose from the AIPC cell line. After NGF/-IFN treatment, the AR-negative cell lines re-expressed AR and were then able to respond to the androgen. Contrary to expectations, the proliferation of cells was inhibited after dihydrotestosterone was added, and the results indicated that NGF/-IFN decreased the proportion of cancer stem cells. NGF/-IFN worked mainly through the downregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2.

Abstract
  The estrogen receptor (ER)1 is successively lost during cancer progression, whereas its splice variant, ER2, is expressed in advanced prostate cancer. The latter form of cancer often metastasizes to bone, and we wanted to investigate whether the loss of ER1 and/or the expression of ER2 affect such signaling pathways in prostate cancer. Using PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines that stably express ER1 or ER2, we found that the ER variants differentially regulate genes known to affect tumor behavior. We found that ER1 repressed the expression of the bone metastasis regulator Runx2 in PC3 cells. By contrast, RUNX2 expression was up-regulated at the mRNA level by ER2 in PC3 cells, whereas Slug was up-regulated by ER2 in both PC3 and 22Rv1 cells. In addition, the expression of Twist1, a factor whose expression strongly correlates with high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma, was increased by ER2. In agreement with the increased Twist1 expression, we found increased expression of Dickkopf homolog 1; Dickkopf homolog 1 is a factor that has been shown to increase the RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio and enhance osteoclastogenesis, indicating that the expression of ER2 can cause osteolytic cancer. Furthermore, we found that only ER1 inhibited proliferation, whereas ER2 increased proliferation. The expression of the proliferation markers Cyclin E, c-Myc, and p45(Skp2) was differentially affected by ER1 and ER2 expression. In addition, nuclear -catenin protein and its mRNA levels were reduced by ER1 expression. In conclusion, we found that ER1 inhibited proliferation and factors known to be involved in bone metastasis, whereas ER2 increased proliferation and up-regulated factors involved in bone metastasis. Thus, in prostate cancer cells, ER2 has oncogenic abilities that are in strong contrast to the tumor-suppressing effects of ER1.

Abstract
  Advanced or metastatic prostate cancer is treated by androgen deprivation; however, patients inevitably relapse with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC remains dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which may include constitutive, ligand-independent action of naturally occurring AR splice variants. For example, the AR splice variant AR3 (also termed AR-V7) is expressed in CRPC and is linked to poor prognosis. Vav3, a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is an AR coactivator that is up-regulated in human prostate cancer compared with benign tissue and in preclinical models of CRPC. Vav3 confers castration-resistant growth to androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells. Despite the importance of AR coactivators in promoting CRPC, the potential role of these regulatory proteins in modulating AR splice variant activity is unknown. We examined the contributions of Vav3 to AR activity in two CRPC cell lines that naturally express relatively high levels of Vav3 and AR3. Vav3 or AR3 knockdown greatly attenuated cell proliferation, soft agar growth, and ligand-independent AR activity. Vav3 potently enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR3 and another clinically relevant AR splice variant, ARv567es. Vav3 knockdown resulted in lowered nuclear AR3 levels, whereas total AR3 levels remained similar. Conversely, overexpression of Vav3 resulted in increased nuclear AR3. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that AR3 and Vav3 interact. These novel data demonstrating physical and functional interactions between Vav3, a unique AR coactivator, and an AR splice variant provide insights into the mechanisms by which Vav3 exploits and enhances AR signaling in the progression to CRPC.

Abstract
  Expression of clusterin (CLU) closely correlates with the regulation of apoptosis in cancer. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced upregulation and retrotranslocation of cytoplasmic CLU (presecretory (psCLU) and secreted (sCLU) forms) has been linked to its anti-apoptotic properties, mechanisms mediating these processes remain undefined. Here, we show using human prostate cancer cells that GRP78 (Bip) associates with CLU under ER stress conditions to facilitate its retrotranslocation and redistribution to the mitochondria. Many ER stress inducers, including thapsigargin, MG132 or paclitaxel, increased expression levels of GRP78 and CLU, as well as post-translationally modified hypoglycosylated CLU forms. ER stress increased association between GRP78 and CLU, which led to increased cytoplasmic CLU levels, while reducing sCLU levels secreted into the culture media. GRP78 stabilized CLU protein and its hypoglycosylated forms, in particular after paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy with CLUGFP indicated that GRP78 increased stress-induced CLU retrotranslocation from the ER with co-localized redistribution to the mitochondria, thereby reducing stress-induced apoptosis by cooperatively stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity. GRP78 silencing reduced CLU protein, but not mRNA levels, and enhanced paclitaxel-induced cell apoptosis. Taken together, these findings reveal novel dynamic interactions between GRP78 and CLU under ER stress conditions that govern CLU trafficking and redistribution to the mitochondria, elucidating how GRP78 and CLU cooperatively promote survival during treatment stress in prostate cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Milk contains numerous nutrients. The content of n-3 fatty acids, the n-6/n-3 ratio, and short- and medium-chain fatty acids may promote positive health effects. In Western societies, cow's milk fat is perceived as a risk factor for health because it is a source of a high fraction of saturated fatty acids. Recently, there has been increasing interest in donkey's milk. In this work, the fat and energetic value and acidic composition of donkey's milk, with reference to human nutrition, and their variations during lactation, were investigated. We also discuss the implications of the acidic profile of donkey's milk on human nutrition.

  METHODS: Individual milk samples from lactating jennies were collected 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 210days after foaling, for the analysis of fat, proteins and lactose, which was achieved using an infrared milk analyser, and fatty acids composition by gas chromatography.

  RESULTS: The donkey's milk was characterised by low fat and energetic (1719.2kJ.kg-1) values, a high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content of mainly -linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), a low n-6 to n-3 FA ratio or LA/ALA ratio, and advantageous values of atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. Among the minor PUFA, docosahesaenoic (DHA), eicosapentanoic (EPA), and arachidonic (AA) acids were present in very small amounts (<1%). In addition, the AA/EPA ratio was low (0.18). The fat and energetic values decreased (P < 0.01) during lactation.The fatty acid patterns were affected by the lactation stage and showed a decrease (P < 0.01) in saturated fatty acids content and an increase (P < 0.01) in the unsaturated fatty acids content. The n-6 to n-3 ratio and the LA/ALA ratio were approximately 2:1, with values <1 during the last period of lactation, suggesting the more optimal use of milk during this period.

  CONCLUSIONS: The high level of unsaturated/saturated fatty acids and PUFA-n3 content and the low n-6/n-3 ratio suggest the use of donkey's milk as a functional food for human nutrition and its potential utilisation for infant nutrition as well as adult diets, particular for the elderly.

Abstract
  Human colostrum and breast milk are known to contain high levels of cytokines and chemokines, which are thought to contribute to the development of the newborn. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in the presence and levels of 21 soluble cytokines and chemokines in paired samples of human colostrum (day 2 after delivery) and breast milk (day 4-5 after delivery) by using the multiplex technology. Of the 21 cytokine investigated in 10 pairs of samples, only -NGF was absent in both colostrum and milk, while INF-2, SCF and TNF- were present in colostrum but not in human milk. As a general rule, colostrum contained higher concentrations of cytokines and chemokines with respect to breast milk. The majority of cytokines, detected in colostrum alone or in colostrum and human milk (IL-1, IL-2R, IL-3, IL-16, IL-18, GRO-, HGF, IFN-2, M-CSF, MIF, MIG, TNF-, SDF-1, TRAIL) have been described in previous studies, while for the first time we describe the presence of additional cytokines either in colostrum alone (SCF) or in both colostrum and breast milk (CTAK/CCL27, MCP-3/CCL7, LIF). Our data confirm and expand previous studies showing that some cytokines/chemokines, which might contribute to the development of the gastro-intestinal and nervous systems, are overexpressed in human colostrum and breast milk, and might contribute to the development of these systems.

Abstract
  The variability of breast-milk zinc concentration is high among breastfeeding women, and it is known to be independent of dietary zinc intake. As a result, transient neonatal zinc deficiency is not rare in the breastfed infants due to low milk zinc concentration in their breastfeeding mothers. Up to now, SLC30A2 has been documented the only candidate gene showing correlation with human milk zinc trait. In this study, 750 breastfeeding women were recruited and 10ml foremilk was collected on 42nd postpartum day. The milk zinc concentration was measured, and genomic DNA was isolated from breast-milk. Direct sequencing and Taqman assay were used to identify the SLC30A2 polymorphisms associated with low-milk-zinc. Subsequently, the factors associated with breast-milk zinc were investigated using regression model. The correlation study showed that SLC30A2/-697G>T and SLC30A2/1031A>G polymorphisms were associated with low-milk-zinc in our subjects. These two polymorphisms explained 3.23% of total variance in milk zinc level. For non-genetic variables, the obese breastfeeding women (BMI>25) secreted less zinc into their breast-milk. The variation of milk zinc was independent of pregnant age, birth weight, infant gender, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery and vitamin D supplementation. In conclusion, our results indicated that -697G>T and 1031A>G polymorphisms in the SLC30A2 gene may be associated with low-milk-zinc in Chinese breastfeeding women. Maternal BMI is significantly correlated with milk zinc level in negative manner. Our study demonstrated that both genetic and non-genetic factors could modulate milk zinc level.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in men. One of the distinct characteristics of prostate cancer is over-expression of the ERG proto-oncogene. The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, the most common gene fusion, is found in approximately 50% of prostate cancer cases. We show that certain microRNAs are extensively deregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and primary clinical cancer samples. MicroRNAs are capable of modulating post-transcriptional gene expression via inhibition of protein synthesis. Independent target prediction methods have indicated that the 3' untranslated region of the ERG mRNA is a potential target of miR-145. miR-145 is consistently down-regulated in prostate cancer. Here we show that the ERG 3' untranslated region is a regulative target of miR-145 in vitro. Ectopic expression of miR-145 led to a reduction in expression of the ERG protein. We analyzed 26 prostate cancer samples and corresponding normal tissue. ERG protein expression was found to be elevated in the tumor samples, together with increased expression of several ERG isoforms. We identified ERG proteins of 35 and 24 kDa, which may represent unknown ERG splice variants. Analyses of miR-145 and ERG mRNA expression revealed a general down-regulation of miR-145 irrespective of the presence or absence of translocations involving ERG. This observation indicates that down-regulation of miR-145 may contribute to the increased expression of most ERG splice variants sharing the miR-145 target sequence in their 3' untranslated region.  2013 The Authors Journal compilation  2013 FEBS.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy of treating benign prostatic hyperplasia and very-low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) in patients receiving active surveillance and 5-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI; finasteride or dutasteride) treatment.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two men with very-low-risk PCa (clinical stage T1c, Gleason score <= 6, <3 biopsy cores positive with <= 50% involvement, and prostate-specific antigen density <= 0.15 ng/mL/g) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (>= 30 cm(3)) received active surveillance and were treated with a 5-ARI.

  RESULTS: All 82 men completed 1 year of 5-ARI therapy (n = 79) or underwent early biopsy for cause (n = 3). Restaging biopsies were performed for 76 men (22 underwent a second restaging biopsy and 1 a third restaging biopsy), 4 patients were awaiting biopsy, and 2 were lost to follow-up before the first restaging biopsy. At the first restaging biopsy, of the 76 men, 41 (54%) had no PCa, 16 (21%) continued to have very-low-risk PCa, 15 (20%) had progressed to low-risk PCa (>2 cores positive and Gleason score <= 6), and 4 (5%) had progressed to intermediate-risk PCa (Gleason score 7). Of the 76 biopsies, 20 were performed early for cause, with 11 (55%) showing PCa progression. Of the 82 patients, 22 (27%) underwent treatment of PCa.

  CONCLUSION: Active surveillance of very-low-risk PCa in the setting of 5-ARI therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia appears to be a safe therapeutic option, because most (57 of 82; 70%) patients maintained very-low-risk PCa or had negative follow-up biopsies during a 3-year follow-up period. Complementary to the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, our results indicate that 5-ARI therapy increases prostate-specific antigen sensitivity and can aid the clinician in appropriately targeting biopsies.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of best clinical judgment (BCJ) and the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) assay in guiding the decision to perform a repeat prostate biopsy (PBx) after a previous negative PBx.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, 12 European urologists established recommendations (BCJ) for the appropriateness of PBx according to the prostate-specific antigen level, digital rectal examination findings, number of previous negative PBxs, prostate volume, and life expectancy, with and without consideration of the PCA3 scores. These recommendations were applied to 1024 subjects receiving placebo in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events trial, including men with a previous negative PBx, a baseline prostate-specific antigen level of 2.5-10 ng/mL, and a PCA3 test performed before the protocol-mandated 2- and 4-year repeat PBxs. Three scenarios (ie, BCJ alone, BCJ with PCA3, and the PCA3 score alone) were tested for their ability to reduce the repeat PBx rate versus missing Gleason sum >= 7 prostate cancer (PCa).

  RESULTS: BCJ with PCA3 would have avoided 64% of repeat PBxs compared with 26% for BCJ alone and 55% for PCA3 alone (cutoff score 20). Of 55 PCa cases (Gleason sum >= 7), 13 would have been missed using BCJ alone compared with 7 using PCA3 (cutoff score 20) alone and 8 using BCJ plus PCA3. The diagnostic accuracy for Gleason sum >= 7 PCa of the BCJ with PCA3 scenario was superior to that of the other scenarios, with a negative predictive value of 99%.

  CONCLUSION: Application of the BCJ together with PCA3 testing can reduce the number of repeat PBxs while maintaining the sensitivity to detect Gleason sum >= 7 PCa. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of hip fracture in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: One of the detrimental side effects of ADT for prostate cancer is osteoporosis. Through an osteoporosis prevention program implemented in our healthcare system, the patients at risk undergo dual x-ray absorptiometry scans and receive treatment if the T-score indicates bone loss. We evaluated the incidence of hip fracture in men with prostate cancer who were receiving ADT through a retrospective, cohort study conducted within a managed care organization. The participants were all men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 2003 to December 2007 receiving leuprolide injections. Patients who had had a dual x-ray absorptiometry scan beginning 3 months before the index date through the end of study were included in the intervention group; all others were included in the comparison group. The main outcome of interest was a hip fracture occurring after the index date, excluding cancer pathologic fractures, traumatic fractures, and fractures associated with epilepsy.

  RESULTS: A total of 1071 patients were in the intervention group, and 411 were in the comparison group. In the intervention group, 18 hip fractures occurred compared with 17 in the comparison group. The incidence rate of hip fractures per 1000 person-years was 5.1 (95% confidence interval 3.0-8.0) in the intervention group and 18.1 (95% confidence interval 10.5-29.0) in the comparison group.

  CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of hip fracture in this population was reduced >70% with enrollment in an osteoporosis management system, avoiding this morbid complication of ADT. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the body mass index (BMI) and serum testosterone concentrations in men receiving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy for prostate cancer.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 66 white men were included in the present study. All subjects had received LHRH agonist therapy for >= 3 months. The BMI was calculated, and the subjects were classified as normal weight (i.e. BMI <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)), or obese (BMI >30 kg/m(2)). The serum testosterone concentration was determined using the highly sensitive isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique. The sex hormone-binding globulin level was determined using an immunometric assay, and the free serum testosterone concentration was calculated.

  RESULTS: The median serum testosterone concentration of the patients with a BMI <25 kg/m(2) was 5.5 ng/dL. The patients with a BMI of 25-30 kg/m(2) had a median serum testosterone concentration of 3.8 ng/dL. Those patients with a BMI >30 kg/m(2) had a median concentration of 5.7 ng/dL. No significant difference in the serum testosterone concentrations among the 3 groups was found. The sex hormone-binding globulin levels declined with an increasing BMI. The concentration of free testosterone was significantly greater in the obese men.

  CONCLUSION: Using an ultrasensitive technique of serum testosterone measurement, the present data have shown that no difference exists in the serum testosterone concentration in the castrate range among normal weight, overweight, and obese patients receiving LHRH agonist therapy for prostate cancer. From our findings and current knowledge, more stringent follow-up or changes in dosage or dosage intervals of LHRH agonist therapy in those with a greater or high BMI is not warranted.

Abstract
  Postprandial triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) transport dietary fatty acids through the circulatory system to satisfy the energy and structural needs of the tissues. However, fatty acids are also able to modulate gene expression and/or induce cell death. We investigated the underlying mechanism by which postprandial TRLs of different fatty acid compositions can induce cell death in human monocytes. Three types of dietary fat [refined olive oil (ROO), high-palmitic sunflower oil (HPSO), and butter] with progressively increasing SFA:MUFA ratios (0.18, 0.41, and 2.08, respectively) were used as a source of postprandial TRLs (TRL-ROO, TRL-HPSO, and TRL-BUTTER) from healthy men. The monocytic cell line THP-1 was used as a model for this study. We demonstrated that postprandial TRLs increased intracellular lipid accumulation (31-106%), reactive oxygen species production (268-349%), DNA damage (133-1467%), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (800-1710%) and caspase-3 (696-1244%) activities, and phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (54 kDa, 141-288%) and p38 (24-92%). These effects were significantly greater with TRL-BUTTER, and TRL-ROO did not induce DNA damage, DNA fragmentation, or p38 phosphorylation. In addition, blockade of p38, but not of JNK, significantly decreased intracellular lipid accumulation and increased cell death in postprandial TRL-treated cells. These results suggest that in human monocytes, p38 is involved in survival signaling pathways that protect against the lipid-mediated cytotoxicity induced by postprandial TRLs that are abundant in saturated fatty acids.

Abstract
  We previously reported the tumor-suppressive activity of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1) through induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IGFBP-rP1 for radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity in hormone-refractory human prostate PC-3 cancer cells. Five assays were performed using PC-3 cells transfected with IGFBP-rP1 (PC-3rP1) and control cells transfected with an empty vector (PC-3N): PC-3rP1 and PC-3N were compared by clonogenic survival assay, cell cycle analysis and apoptotic assay for radiosensitivity. The number of colonies of PC-3rP1 cells significantly decreased after 4 and 8 Gy of irradiation, compared with those of PC-3N in the clonogenic survival assay. After 16 hr irradiation at 8 Gy, the percentage of apoptotic cells significantly increased in PC-3rP1 compared with PC-3N. Growth of PC-3rP1 was significantly lower than that of PC-3N after docetaxel treatment both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that restoration of IGFBP-rP1 to PC-3 cells increases both their radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Ultraconserved regions (UCR) are genomic segments of more than 200 base pairs that are evolutionarily conserved among mammalian species. They are thought to have functions as transcriptional enhancers and regulators of alternative splicing. Recently, it was shown that numerous RNAs are transcribed from these regions. These UCR-encoded transcripts (ucRNAs) were found to be expressed in a tissue- and disease-specific manner and may interfere with the function of other RNAs through RNA: RNA interactions. We hypothesized that ucRNAs have unidentified roles in the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer. In a pilot study, we examined ucRNA expression profiles in human prostate tumors.

  METHODS: Using a custom microarray with 962 probesets representing sense and antisense sequences for the 481 human UCRs, we examined ucRNA expression in resected, fresh-frozen human prostate tissues (57 tumors, 7 non-cancerous prostate tissues) and in cultured prostate cancer cells treated with either epigenetic drugs (the hypomethylating agent, 5-Aza 2'deoxycytidine, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A) or a synthetic androgen, R1881. Expression of selected ucRNAs was also assessed by qRT-PCR and NanoString-based assays. Because ucRNAs may function as RNAs that target protein-coding genes through direct and inhibitory RNA: RNA interactions, computational analyses were applied to identify candidate ucRNA:mRNA binding pairs.

  RESULTS: We observed altered ucRNA expression in prostate cancer (e.g., uc.106+, uc.477+, uc.363 + A, uc.454 + A) and found that these ucRNAs were associated with cancer development, Gleason score, and extraprostatic extension after controlling for false discovery (false discovery rate < 5% for many of the transcripts). We also identified several ucRNAs that were responsive to treatment with either epigenetic drugs or androgen (R1881). For example, experiments with LNCaP human prostate cancer cells showed that uc.287+ is induced by R1881 (P < 0.05) whereas uc.283 + A was up-regulated following treatment with combined 5-Aza 2'deoxycytidine and trichostatin A (P < 0.05). Additional computational analyses predicted RNA loop-loop interactions of 302 different sense and antisense ucRNAs with 1058 different mRNAs, inferring possible functions of ucRNAs via direct interactions with mRNAs.

  CONCLUSIONS: This first study of ucRNA expression in human prostate cancer indicates an altered transcript expression in the disease.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is regulated by a number of different factors, but the mechanism(s) behind androgen-mediated regulation of VEGF in prostate cancer are poorly understood.

  RESULTS: Three novel androgen receptor (AR) binding sites were discovered in the VEGF promoter and in vivo binding of AR to these sites was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these sites attenuated activation of the VEGF promoter by the androgen analog, R1881 in prostate cancer cells. The transcription factors AR and Sp1 were shown to form a nuclear complex and both bound the VEGF core promoter in chromatin of hormone treated CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. The importance of the Sp1 binding site in hormone mediated activation of VEGF expression was demonstrated by site directed mutagenesis. Mutation of a critical Sp1 binding site (Sp1.4) in the VEGF core promoter region prevented activation by androgen. Similarly, suppression of Sp1 binding by Mithramycin A treatment significantly reduced VEGF expression.

  CONCLUSIONS: Our mechanistic study of androgen mediated induction of VEGF expression in prostate cancer cells revealed for the first time that this induction is mediated through the core promoter region and is dependent upon a critical Sp1 binding site. The importance of Sp1 binding suggests that therapy targeting the AR-Sp1 complex may dampen VEGF induced angiogenesis and, thereby, block prostate cancer progression, helping to maintain the indolent form of prostate cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: High salinity and temperature combined with presence of heavy metals and low oxygen renders deep-sea anoxic brines of the Red Sea as one of the most extreme environments on Earth. The ability to adapt and survive in these extreme environments makes inhabiting bacteria interesting candidates for the search of novel bioactive molecules.

  METHODS: Total 20 i.e. lipophilic (chloroform) and hydrophilic (70% ethanol) extracts of marine bacteria isolated from brine-seawater interface of the Red Sea were tested for cytotoxic and apoptotic activity against three human cancer cell lines, i.e. HeLa (cervical carcinoma), MCF-7 (Breast Adenocarcinoma) and DU145 (Prostate carcinoma).

  RESULTS: Among these, twelve extracts were found to be very active after 24 hours of treatment, which were further evaluated for their cytotoxic and apoptotic effects at 48 hr. The extracts from the isolates P1-37B and P3-37A (Halomonas) and P1-17B (Sulfitobacter) have been found to be the most potent against tested cancer cell lines.

  CONCLUSION: Overall, bacterial isolates from the Red Sea displayed promising results and can be explored further to find novel drug-like molecules. The cell line specific activity of the extracts may be attributed to the presence of different polarity compounds or the cancer type i.e. biological differences in cell lines and different mechanisms of action of programmed cell death prevalent in different cancer cell lines.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: One key step in the development of prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis is the loss of E-cadherin expression associated with increased cellular motility and tumor invasion. This loss of E-cadherin expression is also required during normal embryogenesis and similar transcriptional repressors have been identified in both processes. We have previously reported the presence of one such transcription factor, WT1 in high Gleason grade prostate tumor tissues, and its absence in non-neoplastic or benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues.

  RESULTS: To better understand the effect of WT1 on E-cadherin expression and migration of PCa cells we quantified WT1 and E-cadherin mRNA levels in normal prostate epithelial and PCa cell lines with varying migratory potential. In WT1 transfected cells E-cadherin transcript levels were decreased, while they were increased in siWT1-RNA transfected PCa cells, suggesting that elevated WT1 expression was sufficient to dampen E-cadherin levels and potentially enhance migratory ability. To delineate the mechanism of WT1-mediated repression of E-cadherin, potential WT1 binding sites were tested in vitro and in vivo binding of WT1 to the E-cadherin promoter in the chromatin of LNCaP and PC3 cells was assessed by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation. The effect of WT1 binding was measured in reporter assays; in PC3 and DU145 cells WT1 decreased the activity of the proximal E-cadherin promoter. Using site-directed mutagenesis, a newly identified WT1 binding site located 146 bp from the transcription start site was shown to be required for this repression by WT1. Transwell migration and wound healing assays revealed that in LNCaP cells with low migratory potential, over-expression of WT1 was sufficient to enhance migration, conversely, in the highly migratory PC3 cells silencing of WT1 decreased migration.

  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that WT1 expression in high grade prostate cancer may contribute to migration and metastasis. Thus, in prostate cancer WT1 may function as a novel oncogene facilitating development of the lethal metastatic phenotype.

Abstract
  The abundance of miRNAs - small non-coding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression - in tissues and body fluids of cancer patients hold great promise to identify specific biomarkers, which may be useful for early diagnosis as well as to predict the clinical outcome and treatment response. For the extraction and quantification of miRNAs from cells and tissues, present technologies for transcriptome analyses like microarrays, quantitative real-time PCR or next generation sequencing can be applied. However, the analyses of miRNAs in body fluids like serum or urine is still a challenge with respect to the nucleic acid recovery from very limited sources of biomaterial, normalization strategies and validation using independent technologies. The presence of specific miRNA patterns in body fluids like serum of cancer patients suggests a promising role of these molecules as surrogate markers. However, the majority of miRNA studies were addressed in relatively small patient cohorts limiting the validity and the clinical application of potential miRNA biomarkers or signatures. We reflect the critical steps to translate miRNA biomarker into clinical routine diagnostics and present future aspects for the fast, robust and standardized quantification of miRNAs in body fluids.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: miRNAs can act as oncomirs or tumor-suppressor miRs in cancer. This study was undertaken to investigate the status and role of miR-34b in prostate cancer.

  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Profiling of miR-34b was carried out in human prostate cancer cell lines and clinical samples by quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. Statistical analyses were done to assess diagnostic/prognostic potential. Biological significance was elucidated by carrying out a series of experiments in vitro and in vivo.

  RESULTS: We report that miR-34b is silenced in human prostate cancer and the mechanism is through CpG hypermethylation. miR-34b directly targeted methyltransferases and deacetylases resulting in a positive feedback loop inducing partial demethylation and active chromatin modifications. miR-34b expression could predict overall and recurrence-free survival such that patients with high miR-34b levels had longer survival. Functionally, miR-34b inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion, and triggered G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by directly targeting the Akt and its downstream proliferative genes. miR-34b caused a decline in the mesenchymal markers vimentin, ZO1, N-cadherin, and Snail with an increase in E-cadherin expression, thus inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Finally we showed the antitumor effect of miR-34b in vivo. MiR-34b caused a dramatic decrease in tumor growth in nude mice compared with cont-miR.

  CONCLUSION: These findings offer new insight into the role of miR-34b in the inhibition of prostate cancer through demethylation, active chromatin modification, and Akt pathways and may provide a rationale for the development of new strategies targeting epigenetic regulation of miRNAs for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract
  Twelve different biogenic amines formation in 58 isolates of Streptococcus thermophilus from home-made natural yogurt were investigated in histidine (HDB) and lysine decarboxylase broth (LDB). All S. thermophilus isolates had an ability to produce twelve different biogenic amines in HDB and LDB. Most of the S. thermophilus isolates formed low amounts of histamine (1-50 mg/L) from histidine. Apart from one isolate, S. thermophilus produced tyramine at low (47 isolates) and medium (10 isolates) levels. The amount of each specific biogenic amine produced by S. thermophilus was generally lower than 100 mg L(-1). Also, the presence of hdcA gene was investigated using PCR technique and relation between gene and histamine production was conducted in S. thermophilus isolates. This study showed that most of the S. thermophilus isolates have the ability to form biogenic amines, especially histamine, and tyramine, which is an important consideration when selecting strains as starter cultures.

Abstract
  The binding sites of retinol and retinoic acid with milk - and -caseins were determined, using constant protein concentration and various retinoid contents. FTIR, UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopic methods as well as molecular modelling were used to analyse retinol and retinoic acid binding sites, the binding constant and the effect of retinoid complexation on the stability and conformation of caseins. Structural analysis showed that retinoids bind caseins via both hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts with overall binding constants of K(retinol-)()(-caseins)=1.21 (+/-0.4)x10(5) M(-1) and K(retinol-)()(-caseins)=1.11 (+/-0.5)x10(5) M(-1) and K(retinoic acid-)()(-caseins)=6.2 (+/-0.6)x10(4) M(-1) and K(retinoic acid-)()(-caseins)=6.3 (+/-0.6)x10(4) M(-1). The number of bound retinol molecules per protein (n) was 1.5 (+/-0.1) for -casein and 1.0 (+/-0.1) for -casein, while 1 molecule of retinoic acid was bound in the - and -casein complexes. Molecular modelling showed different binding sites for retinol and retinoic acid on - and -caseins with more stable complexes formed with -casein. Retinoid-casein complexation induced minor alterations of protein conformation. Caseins might act as carriers for transportation of retinoids to target molecules. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  Wine grape pomace (WGP) as a source of antioxidant dietary fibre (ADF) was fortified in yogurt (Y), Italian (I) and Thousand Island (T) salad dressings. During the 3 weeks of storage at 4 C, viscosity and pH of WGP-Y increased and decreased, respectively, but syneresis and lactic acid percentage of WGP-Y and pH of WGP-I and WGP-T were stable. Adding WGP resulted in 35-65% reduction of peroxide values in all samples. Dried whole pomace powder (WP) fortified products had dietary fibre content of 0.94-3.6% (w/w product), mainly insoluble fractions. Total phenolic content and DPPH radical scavenging activity were 958-1340 mg GAE/kg product and 710-936 mg AAE/kg product, respectively. The highest ADF was obtained in 3% WP-Y, 1% WP-I and 2% WP-T, while 1% WP-Y, 0.5% WP-I and 1% WP-T were mostly liked by consumers based on the sensory study. Study demonstrated that WGP may be used as a functional food ingredient for promoting human health and extending shelf-life of food products. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Myricetin and myricitrin are naturally occurring flavonoids have been suggested to play a role in inhibition of proliferation and transformation of carcinogenic cell. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their activity have not yet to be revealed. The aim of the present study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis cell on the prostate cancer induced by myricetin, myricitrin, quercetin and quercitrin. The MTT assay confirmed that myricetin had the strongest inhibitory effect on human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, myricitrin was second, and quercitrin was the weakest. A noticeable synergistic effect was observed with the inhibition of cell proliferation when myricetin was used in combination with myricitrin. In the concentration range of 37.5-300 umol/L, the inhibitory effects of these flavonoids were enhanced with increasing dose and treatment time. The acridine orange analysis and annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining results confirmed that myricetin and myricitrin were effective in inducing PC-3 cell apoptosis. The results showed that myricetin was more effective than myricitrin in inducing cell apoptosis. The apoptosis rate increased with increasing flavonoid concentration in a dose dependent manner. A synergistic effect was observed on the apoptosis rate when myricetin was used in combination with myricitrin. Crown Copyright  2012. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Temporal growth of tumor xenografts in mice on a control diet was compared to mice supplemented daily with 3 mol/g of the cancer preventive compound phenethyl isothiocyanate. Phenethyl isothiocyanate decreased the rate of tumor growth. The effects of phenethyl isothiocyanate on tumor growth were examined by RNAseq to elucidate molecular changes that may contribute to tumor growth suppression. Bio-informatic analysis of differentially expressed genes identified changes in inflammation and extracellular matrix pathways that were modulated by treatment with phenethyl isothiocyanate. Specific gene expression changes in these pathways included up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, fibronectin, thyroxine degradation enzyme, and down regulation of integrin beta 6. In addition, feeding phenethyl isothiocyanate induced alternative splicing of gene variants. This study represents the first use of RNAseq to analyze tumors from animals consuming dietary phenethyl isothiocyanate and to identify potential molecular signatures that may explain the cancer protective effect of this compound.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Myoblasts can form muscle fibers after transplantation. Therefore, they are envisioned as a treatment for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy. However, to our knowledge the safety of this treatment and the interaction of myoblasts with any remaining neighboring cancer are unknown. We investigated the interactions between myoblasts and prostate carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Myoblasts isolated from the rectus abdominis were used in a series of co-culture experiments with prostate cancer cells and subcutaneously co-injected in vivo. Cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer in co-culture with myoblasts were assessed. Tumor volume and metastasis formation were evaluated in a mouse model. Tissue specific markers were assessed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, Western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

  RESULTS: Myoblasts in proximity to tumor provided paracrine tumor necrosis factor- to their microenvironment, decreasing the tumor growth of all prostate cancer cell lines examined. Co-culture experiments revealed induction of cell cycle arrest, tumor death by apoptosis and increased myoblast differentiation. This effect was largely blocked by tumor necrosis factor- inhibition. The same outcome was noted in a mouse model, in which co-injected human myoblasts also inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis formation of all prostate cancer cell lines evaluated.

  CONCLUSIONS: Myoblasts restrict prostate cancer growth and limit metastasis formation by paracrine tumor necrosis factor- secretion in vitro and in vivo. Copyright  2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Mitotic progression of mammalian cells is tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex (APC)/C. Deregulation of APC/C is frequently observed in cancer cells and is suggested to contribute to chromosome instability and cancer predisposition. In this study, we identified Daxx as a novel APC/C inhibitor frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer. Daxx interacts with the APC/C coactivators Cdc20 and Cdh1 in vivo, with the binding of Cdc20 dependent on the consensus destruction boxes near the N-terminal of the Daxx protein. Ectopic expression of Daxx, but not the D-box deleted mutant (DaxxD-box), inhibited the degradation of APC/Cdc20 and APC/Cdh1 substrates, leading to a transient delay in mitotic progression. Daxx is frequently upregulated in prostate cancer tissues; the expression level positively correlated with the Gleason score and disease metastasis (P = 0.027 and 0.032, respectively). Furthermore, ectopic expression of Daxx in a non-malignant prostate epithelial cell line induced polyploidy under mitotic stress. Our data suggest that Daxx may function as a novel APC/C inhibitor, which promotes chromosome instability during prostate cancer development.

Abstract
  Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) share common progenitors with osteoclasts and are critical components of bone-tumor microenvironment; however, their function in prostate tumor growth in the skeleton has not been explored. BMMs are the major source of inflammatory factors and proteases, including cysteine protease cathepsin K (CTSK). In this study, utilizing mice deficient in CTSK, we demonstrate the critical involvement of this potent collagenase in tumor progression in bone. We present the evidence that tumor growth and progression in the bone are impaired in the absence of CTSK. Most importantly, we show for the first time that BMM-supplied CTSK may be involved in CCL2- and COX-2-driven pathways that contribute to tumor progression in bone. Together, our data unravel novel roles for CTSK in macrophage-regulated processes, and provide evidence for close interplay between inflammatory, osteolytic and tumor cell-driven events in the bone-tumor microenvironment.

Abstract
  B-cell leukemia 3 (Bcl-3) is a member of the inhibitor of kB family, which regulates a wide range of biological processes by functioning as a transcriptional activator or as a repressor of target genes. As high levels of Bcl-3 expression and activation have been detected in different types of human cancer, Bcl-3 has been labeled a proto-oncogene. Our study uncovered a markedly upregulated Bcl-3 expression in human prostate cancer (PCa), where inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Elevated Bcl-3 expression in PCa was dependent on the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6-mediated STAT3 activation. Microarray analyses, using Bcl-3 knockdown in PCa cells, identified the inhibitor of DNA-binding (Id) family of helix-loop-helix proteins as potential Bcl-3-regulated genes. Bcl-3 knockdown reduced the abundance of Id-1 and Id-2 proteins and boosted PCa cells to be more receptive to undergoing apoptosis following treatment with anticancer drug. Our data imply that inactivation of Bcl-3 may lead to sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy in PCa treatment.

Abstract
  The association between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and prostate cancer has been evaluated. However, the results of these studies on the association remain conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify the eligible studies of COMT Val158Met polymorphism and prostate cancer risk. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for COMT Val158Met polymorphism and prostate cancer were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with the software program Review Manage (Version 5.0) and Stata (Version 12.0). Six case-control studies, totally 4,118 persons including 2,143 cases and 1,975 controls, met the included criteria and thus were selected. Our analysis suggested that Val158Met polymorphism was associated with prostate cancer risk in overall population. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that significant associations of COMT Val158Met polymorphisms with prostate cancer were observed (for additive model: OR=1.068, 95% CI=1.002-1.138, P (heterogeneity)=0.363, P=0.043; for dominant model: OR=1.266, 95% CI=1.057-1.517, P (heterogeneity)=0.000, P=0.011; for recessive model: OR=1.050, 95% CI=0.961-1.146, P (heterogeneity)=0.558, P=0.279; and Val allele versus Met allele OR=0.932, 95% CI=0.894-0.971, P (heterogeneity)=0.272, P=0.001). In the subgroup analysis, we detected no significant association between the COMT 158 Val/Met genotype and prostate cancer risk in Caucasian and Asian populations, while the contrary result for additive model (OR=2.43, 95% CI=1.08-5.43, P (heterogeneity)=0.04, P=0.03) in Asian populations. The result of this meta-analysis suggests that COMT l58Val/Met polymorphism might be contributed to the overall prostate cancer risk.

Abstract
  To establish a system to study differentiation therapy drugs, we used the androgen-independent human prostate PC-3 tumor cell line as a target and - and -tocopherol as inducers. Effects of - and -tocopherol on the cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation, were examined. A more significant growth inhibition activity for - than for -tocopherol was observed. Flow cytometry analysis of - and -tocopherol-treated prostate carcinoma PC3 cells showed decreased progression into the S-phase. This effect, particularly evident for -tocopherol, was associated with an up-regulation and increased activity of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a reduced DNA synthesis and a remarkable decreased levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. Activation of TG2 suggests that -tocopherol has an evident differentiative capacity on PC3 cells, leading to an increased expression of TG2, and reduced cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels, affecting cell cycle progression. It is feasible that up-regulation and activation of TG2, associated with a reduced proliferation, are parts of a large-scale reprogramming that can attenuate the malignant phenotype of PC3 cells in vitro. These data suggest further investigation on the potential use of this -form of vitamin E as a differentiative agent, in combination with the common cytotoxic treatments for prostate cancer therapy.

Abstract
  The multiple enzymatic activities and functions of transglutaminase type 2 (TG2) may be attributed to alternative TG2 molecules produced by differential splicing of TG2 mRNA. Different RNA transcripts of the human TG2 gene (TGM2) have been identified, but the expression of TG2 multiple transcripts has never been systematically addressed. We have confirmed and rationalized the main TG2 variants and developed a screening assay for the detection of alternative splicing of TG2, based on real-time reverse-transcription PCR. We have quantified the multiple TG2 transcripts in a wide range of normal tissues and in cancer cell lines from four different sites of origin. Our data show a significant correlation in the expression of canonical and alternative TG2 isoforms in normal human tissue, but differences in alternative splicing of TG2 in cancer cell lines, suggesting that in cancer cells the alternative splicing of TG2 is a more active process.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in elderly men worldwide and its incidence rate is rising continuously. Agents capable of inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells seem a promising approach to treat this malignancy. In this study we describe the synthesis of a number of novel N- and N,N'-substituted S-2,3,4,5,6-pentabromobenzylisothiouronium bromides and their activity against the human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cell line. All the compounds produced changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cell cycle progression, showed a cytostatic effect and induced apoptosis in the tested cancer line in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The most effective compounds ZKK-3, ZKK-9 and ZKK-13 produced, at 20 microM concentration, apoptosis in 42, 46, and 66% of the cells, respectively, after 48 h incubation. Two selected S-2,3,4,5,6-pentabromobenzylisothiouronium bromides (ZKK-3, ZKK-9) showed also a synergic proapoptotic effect with the new casein kinase II inhibitor 2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (TBIPIP) in the PC3 cell line.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The risk of different cancers seems to be associated with obesity. Moreover, low ghrelin levels observed in obese people may be implicated in cancer development and progression. The aim of this study was to examine the direct effects of both forms of ghrelin (acylated and unacylated) and ghrelin receptor type 1a antagonist (D-Lys-GHRP-6) on the growth of murine colon cancer MC38 and human prostate cancer DU145 cell lines in vitro.

  METHODS: The cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of rat or human acylated ghrelin (rG, hG), human unacylated ghrelin (hUAG), D-Lys-GHRP-6 (GHS-RA) applied either alone or jointly. The cell line growth was assessed by the colorimetric Mosmann method.

  RESULTS: hUAG (10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-10) M) inhibited MC38 cancer cell growth and, at some concentrations (10(-8), 10(-9), 10(-10) M), enhanced the antineoplastic effect of GHS-RA(10(-4) M). In turn, GHS-RA evoked a biphasic effect on MC38 cancer growth: inhibitory at 10(-4) M and stimulatory at 10(-5) and 10(-6) M. Moreover, GHS-RA at the highest examined concentration (10(-4) M) enhanced the cytostatic effect of FU. Human acylated and unacylated ghrelin and GHS-RA inhibited DU145 cancer growth with moderate and different potencies. A dose-response effect was observed for the inhibitory action of hG together with the synergistic effect of hUAG and GHS-RA.

  CONCLUSION: The obtained results indicate an involvement of the ghrelin axis in the growth regulation of colon and prostate cancers and may suggest new therapeutic options for these neoplasms.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Changes in cell shape and plasticity in cytoskeletal dynamics are critically involved in cell adhesion, migration, invasion and the overall process of metastasis. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that the synthetic steroid mifepristone inhibited the growth of highly metastatic cancer cells, while simultaneously causing striking changes in cellular morphology. Here we assessed whether such morphological alterations developed in response to cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone are reversible or permanent, involve rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins, and/or affect the adhesive capacity of the cells.

  METHODS: Cancer cell lines of the ovary (SKOV-3), breast (MDA-MB-231), prostate (LNCaP), and nervous system (U87MG) were exposed to cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone and studied by phase-contrast microscopy. The transient or permanent nature of the cytostasis and morphological changes caused by mifepristone was assessed, as well as the rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins. De-adhesion and adhesion assays were utilized to determine if mifepristone-arrested and morphologically dysregulated cells had abnormal de-adhesion/adhesion dynamics when compared to vehicle-treated controls.

  RESULTS: Mifepristone-treated cells displayed a long, thin, spindle-like shape with boundaries resembling those of loosely adhered cells. Growth arrest and morphology changes caused by mifepristone were reversible in SKOV-3, MDA-MB-231 and U87MG, but not in LNCaP cells that instead became senescent. All cancer cell types exposed to mifepristone displayed greatly increased actin ruffling in association with accelerated de-adhesion from the culture plate, and delayed adhesion capacity to various extracellular matrix components.

  CONCLUSIONS: Cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone induced alterations in the cellular structure of a panel of aggressive, highly metastatic cancer cells of different tissues of origin. Such changes were associated with re-distribution of actin fibers that mainly form non-adhesive membrane ruffles, leading to dysregulated cellular adhesion capacity.

Abstract
  To investigate the immunoglobulin G (IgG) expression in prostate cancer cell lines and explore the effects of IGHG1 gene knockdown on PC3 cell growth and apoptosis. Flow cytometry, qPCR and western blot were used to demonstrate IgG expression in prostate cancer cell lines. PC3 cells were transfected with designed siRNA, the expression of IgG was determined by qPCR and western blot, the proliferation and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenil)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) and flow cytometry. The percentages of IgG in LNCaP cell membrane and cytoplasm were 2.96 and 89.22 % by flow cytometer, those of PC3 cell were 86.73 and 90.99 % respectively. The average level of IgG1 mRNA expression in PC3 cell line was significantly higher than that in LNCaP cell line (3.08 +/- 0.15 vs 1.00 +/- 0.37, P = 0.001). The protein level of IgG expression of PC3 cell line was 1.92 +/- 0.15, compared with LNCaP cell line (1.05 +/- 0.86). The expression of IgG1 mRNA and protein level in transfected PC3 cells decreased, with significant statistical differences from the blank control group (P < 0.01). The PC3 cell growth inhibition rates were 31.3 and 43.3 % in 48 and 72 h respectively. The rate of apoptotic PC3 cells were 5.29 +/- 0.41 % in experimental group higher than that in control group (1.49 +/- 0.29 %) (P < 0.01). IgG was identified in prostate cancer cells, and the siRNA targeted silencing of IGHG1 can inhibit cell viability and promote apoptosis, which might therefore act as a potential target in prostate cancer gene therapy.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed internal malignancies affecting men. Due to the important roles of IL-6 in different physiological and pathophysiological processes, IL-6 polymorphisms may modulate PCa risk. IL-6 -174 G>C (rs 1800795, also designated -236 G>C) and -636 G>C (rs 1800796, also designated -572 G>C) promoter polymorphisms have been implicated in PCa susceptibility, albeit still controversial. A literature search using PubMed and Highwire databases was conducted, resulting in eight case-control studies concerning the IL-6 -174 G>C polymorphism (11,613 PCa cases and 13,992 controls) and four case-control publications regarding the IL-6 -636 G>C polymorphism (1,941 PCa cases and 3,357 controls). In order to derive a more precise estimation, a meta-analysis based upon these selected case-control studies was performed. There was no significant association between IL-6 -174 G>C polymorphism and PCa increased risk. Nevertheless, the presence of allele C and the CC genotype were statistically significantly associated with decreased PCa risk in the overall analysis for IL-6 -636 G>C polymorphism. Additional studies in larger samples and analyses of functional repercussions of these SNPs in prostate tumor cells are necessary to validate these findings.

Abstract
  DNAmethylation plays an important role in carcinogenesis and is being recognized as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for a variety of malignancies including Prostate cancer (PCa). The human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) have emerged as an important family of cancer biomarkers, with KLK3, encoding for Prostate Specific Antigen, being most recognized. However, few studies have examined the epigenetic regulation of KLKs and its implications to PCa. To assess the biological effect of DNA methylation on KLK6 and KLK10 expression, we treated PC3 and 22RV1 PCa cells with a demethylating drug, 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine, and observed increased expression of both KLKs, establishing that DNA methylation plays a role in regulating gene expression. Subsequently, we have quantified KLK6 and KLK10 DNA methylation levels in two independent cohorts of PCa patients operated by radical prostatectomy between 2007-2011 (Cohort I, n = 150) and 1998-2001 (Cohort II, n = 124). In Cohort I, DNA methylation levels of both KLKs were significantly higher in cancerous tissue vs. normal. Further, we evaluated the relationship between DNA methylation and clinicopathological parameters. KLK6 DNA methylationwas significantly associated with pathological stage only in Cohort I while KLK10 DNA methylation was significantly associated with pathological stage in both cohorts. In Cohort II, low KLK10 DNA methylation was associated with biochemical recurrence in univariate and multivariate analyses. A similar trend for KLK6 DNA methylation was observed. The results suggest that KLK6 and KLK10 DNA methylation distinguishes organ confined from locally invasive PCa and may have prognostic value.

Abstract
  Antisense oligonucleotides (oligos) have been employed against in vivo and in vitro prostate cancer models targeting growth regulatory proteins. In LNCaP cells, we evaluated both monospecific and bispecific oligos that targeted and comparably suppressed the expression of bcl-2, an apoptosis inhibitory protein. Cells compensated with both suppressed caspase-3 (an apoptosis promoter) activity, and an enhancement of both androgen receptor (AR) and p300 expression. This suggests that a progression to increased androgen sensitivity accompanies bcl-2 suppression, in this tumor line. To further evaluate mechanisms of adaptation, we now evaluate the effects upon the expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and another AR coactivator, IL-4, thought to increase prostate cancer growth. IGF1 expression was not significantly altered suggesting this pathway need not be regulated when bcl-2 directed gene therapy is employed. In contrast to increased AR and p300 expression that compensated for bcl-2 suppression, the AR coactivator IL-4 expression was not increased, suggesting no role in any increased androgen sensitivity.

Abstract
  The global physiological function of specifically expressed genes of prostate cancer in Chinese patients is unclear. This study aims to determine the genome-wide expression of genes related to prostate cancer in the Chinese population. Genes that were differentially expressed in prostate cancer were identified using DNA microarray technology. Expressions were validated by using real-time PCR. The identified genes were analyzed using the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to investigate the gene ontology, functional pathway and network. A total of 1,444 genes (Fold time >= 1.5; P <= 0.05) were differentially expressed in prostate primary tumor tissue compared with benign tissue. IPA revealed a unique landscape where inductions of certain pathways were involved in Cell Cycle Regulation and proliferation. Network analysis not only confirmed that protein interactions lead to the deregulation of DNA Replication, Recombination and Repair, Cellular Compromise and Cell Cycle, Genetic Disorders and Connective Tissue Disorders, but it was also observed that many of the genes regulated by Myc contributed to the modulation of lipid Metabolism and Nucleic Acid Metabolism. Both pathway and network analysis exhibited some remarkable characteristics of prostate cancer for Chinese patients, which showed profound differences from that of other non-Chinese populations. These differences may provide new insights into the molecular cascade of prostate cancer that occurs in Chinese patients.

Abstract
  As a main effector in the renin-angiotensin system, the angiotensin II plays a critical role in cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The change between angiotensin II and its precursor is conducted by the angiotensin-converting enzyme. The association between angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism and the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme was testified. Furthermore, previous researches proved the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and the risk of prostate cancer. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study in the Han population of China to elaborate the relation between the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism and prostate cancer. DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 189 pathologically diagnosed prostate cancer patients and 290 cancer-free subjects. The angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Stratified analyses on age (<71 or >= 71), cancer stage (localized or advanced), Gleason score (<7 or >= 7) and PSA level (<20 ng/ml or >= 20 ng/ml) were performed. We found the II genotype (OR = 0.304 95%CI (0.180,0.515), P < 0.001) and I allele (OR = 0.547 95%CI(0.421,0.711), P < 0.001) were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer compared with the DD genotype and D allele. The DD genotype was related to patients with aggressive stage of prostate cancer (OR = 2.214 95%CI(1.169, 4.194), P = 0.014) and patients diagnosed of prostate cancer at a relatively early age (OR = 0.513 95%CI(0.272, 0.965), P = 0.037). The results of our experiment supported the hypothesis that the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism, a potential risk factor in carcinogenesis, played an important role in the Han population of China.

Abstract
  The androgen receptor (AR) is essential for diverse aspects of prostate development and function. Molecular mechanisms by which prostate cancer (PC) cells redirect AR signaling to genes that primarily support growth are unclear. A systematic search for critical AR-tethering proteins led to ELK1, an ETS transcription factor of the ternary complex factor subfamily. Although genetically redundant, ELK1 was obligatory for AR-dependent growth and clonogenic survival in both hormone-dependent PC and castration-recurrent PC cells but not for AR-negative cell growth. AR required ELK1 to up-regulate a major subset of its target genes that was strongly and primarily enriched for cell growth functions. AR functioned as a coactivator of ELK1 by association through its A/B domain, bypassing the classical mechanism of ELK1 activation by phosphorylation and without inducing ternary complex target genes. The ELK1-AR synergy per se was ligand-independent, although it required ligand for nuclear localization of AR as targeting the AR A/B domain to the nucleus recapitulated the action of hormone; accordingly, Casodex was a poor antagonist of the synergy. ELK3, the closest substitute for ELK1 in structure/function and genome recognition, did not interact with AR. ELK1 thus directs selective and sustained gene induction that is a substantial and critical component of growth signaling by AR in PC cells. The ELK1-AR interaction offers a functionally tumor-selective drug target.

Abstract
  Tumor progression is deeply influenced by epigenetic changes induced by tumor stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been reported to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, thereby enhancing their aggressiveness and stem-like properties. As CAFs are able to recruit endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to tumor site, we aim to investigate their interplay for prostate carcinoma progression. Both prostate CAFs and cancer cells actively recruit EPCs, known to affect tumor progression through increased vasculogenesis. EPCs synergize with CAFs to further promote epigenetic plasticity of cancer cells, through a mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition. Indeed, after fibroblasts have engaged epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, a further shift towards amoeboid motility is promoted by EPCs through contact-mediated triggering of the bidirectional ephrinA1/EphA2 signaling. The activation of ephrinA1 reverse pathway enhances EPC-induced neo-vascularization, thus promoting tumor growth, while EphA2 forward signaling elicits mesenchymal-amoeboid transition in cancer cells, favoring their adhesion to endothelium, transendothelial migration, and lung metastatic colonization. We therefore underscore that the metastatic advantage given by tumor microenvironment embraces different motility strategies and propose EphA2-targeted tools as useful adjuvants in anti-metastatic treatments.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Pathway analysis of large-scale omics data assists us with the examination of the cumulative effects of multiple functionally related genes, which are difficult to detect using the traditional single gene/marker analysis. So far, most of the genomic studies have been conducted in a single domain, e.g., by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or microarray gene expression investigation. A combined analysis of disease susceptibility genes across multiple platforms at the pathway level is an urgent need because it can reveal more reliable and more biologically important information.

  RESULTS: We performed an integrative pathway analysis of a GWAS dataset and a microarray gene expression dataset in prostate cancer. We obtained a comprehensive pathway annotation set from knowledge-based public resources, including KEGG pathways and the prostate cancer candidate gene set, and gene sets specifically defined based on cross-platform information. By leveraging on this pathway collection, we first searched for significant pathways in the GWAS dataset using four methods, which represent two broad groups of pathway analysis approaches. The significant pathways identified by each method varied greatly, but the results were more consistent within each method group than between groups. Next, we conducted a gene set enrichment analysis of the microarray gene expression data and found 13 pathways with cross-platform evidence, including "Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis" (P GWAS = 0.003, P expr < 0.001, and P combined = 6.18 x 10(-8)), "regulation of actin cytoskeleton" (P GWAS = 0.003, P expr = 0.009, and P combined = 3.34 x 10(-4)), and "Jak-STAT signaling pathway" (P GWAS = 0.001, P expr = 0.084, and P combined = 8.79 x 10(-4)).

  CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence at both the genetic variation and expression levels that several key pathways might have been involved in the pathological development of prostate cancer. Our framework that employs gene expression data to facilitate pathway analysis of GWAS data is not only feasible but also much needed in studying complex disease.

Abstract
  Biofiltration, whereby CH(4) is oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria, is a potentially effective strategy for mitigating CH(4) emissions from anaerobic dairy effluent lagoons/ponds, which typically produce insufficient biogas for energy recovery. This study reports on the effectiveness of a biofilter cover design at oxidizing CH(4) produced by dairy effluent ponds. Three substrates, a volcanic pumice soil, a garden-waste compost, and a mixture of the two, were tested as media for the biofilters. All substrates were suspended as 5 cm covers overlying simulated dairy effluent ponds. Methane fluxes supplied to the filters were commensurate with emission rates from typical dairy effluent ponds. All substrates oxidized more than 95% of the CH(4) influx (13.9 g CH(4) m(-3) h(-1)) after two months and continued to display high oxidation rates for the remaining one month of the trial. The volcanic soil biofilters exhibited the highest oxidation rates (99% removal). When the influx CH(4) dose was doubled for a month, CH(4) removal rates remained >90% for all substrates (maximum = 98%, for the volcanic soil), suggesting that biofilters have a high capacity to respond to increases in CH(4) loads. Nitrous oxide emissions from the biofilters were negligible (maximum = 19.9 mg N(2)O m(-3) h(-1)) compared with CH(4) oxidation rates, particularly from the volcanic soil that had a much lower microbial-N (75 mg kg(-1)) content than the compost-based filters (>240 mg kg(-1)). The high and sustained CH(4) oxidation rates observed in this laboratory study indicate that a biofilter cover design is a potentially efficient method to mitigate CH(4) emissions from dairy effluent ponds. The design should now be tested under field conditions.

Abstract
  Implanted human, androgen-independent prostatic carcinoma cells (DU145) into athymic (NCr nu/nu) mice produce diverse tumors on the peritoneal surfaces of many organs. Light and ultrastructural observations show that the mesothelial covering these surfaces are typically microvilli-coated, squamous cells or secretory cuboidal cells. The peritoneal regions colonized by tumors lack mesothelial cells and are covered by actively replicating carcinoma cells that grow as poorly differentiated cell clusters made of cell aggregates to somewhat compact spheroids covered with pleiomorphic microvilli and containing an undifferentiated vascular supply. These xenografts clusters invade the diaphragm and develop into tumors with both a basal solid aspect and an upper region of cribriform morphology. Furthermore, each tumor contains two cell types: (1) a poorly differentiated clear cell type, which grows into intraperitoneal tumors and (2) a large, basophilic cell type, which invades the peritoneal stroma of organs, including of the diaphragm.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in US men. There is broad evidence that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors are important in prostate cancer initiation and progression, but the contribution of particular FGFs in this disease is not fully understood. The FGF family members FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 comprise a distinct subfamily that circulate in serum and act in an endocrine manner. These endocrine FGFs require -Klotho (KL) and/or -Klotho (KLB), two related single-pass transmembrane proteins restricted in their tissue distribution, to act as coreceptors along with classic FGF receptors (FGFR) to mediate potent biologic activity. Here we show that FGF19 is expressed in primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissues, where it functions as an autocrine growth factor. Exogenous FGF19 promoted the growth, invasion, adhesion, and colony formation of prostate cancer cells at low ligand concentrations. FGF19 silencing in prostate cancer cells expressing autocrine FGF19 decreased invasion and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Consistent with these observations, KL and/or KLB were expressed in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, raising the possibility that additional endocrine FGFs may also exert biologic effects in prostate cancer. Our findings support the concept that therapies targeting FGFR signaling may have efficacy in prostate cancer and highlight FGF19 as a relevant endocrine FGF in this setting. 2013 AACR.

Abstract
  Today, the majority of prostate tumors are detected at early stages with uncertain prognosis. Therefore, we set out to identify early predictive markers of prostate cancer with aggressive progression characteristics. We measured the expression of microRNAs (miRNA) using qRT-PCR in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded prostatic tissue samples from a Swedish cohort of 49 patients with prostate cancer and 25 without cancer and found seven of 13 preselected miRNAs to discriminate between the two groups. Subsequently, four discriminatory miRNAs were combined to a quota, denoted the miRNA index quote (miQ); ((miR-96-5p x miR-183-5p)/(miR-145-5p x miR221-5p)). The advantage of using a quote is increased discrimination, no need for house-keepings, and most important it may be an advantage considering the heterogeneity of the disease. miQ was found to successfully predict diagnosis (p < 0.0001) with high accuracy (area under the curve, AUC = 0.931) that was verified in an independent Dutch cohort and three external cohorts, and significantly outperforming prostate-specific antigen. Importantly, miQ also has prognostic power to predict aggressiveness of tumors (AUC = 0.895), metastatic statues (AUC = 0.827) and overall survival (p = 0.0013, Wilcoxon test HR = 6.5, median survival 2 vs. 5 years), verified in the Dutch cohort. In this preliminary study, we propose that miQ has potential to be used as a clinical tool for prostate cancer diagnosis and as a prognostic marker of disease progression. Copyright  2012 UICC.

Abstract
  AIM: Although prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies in men, there is no effective curative therapy for the advanced disease. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to generate prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)xCD3 diabodies as a novel treatment option for this tumor.

  METHODS: A PSMAxCD3 diabody and a covalently linked single-chain diabody were constructed from the anti-PSMA single-chain Fv fragment D7 and an anti-CD3 single-chain Fv fragment. The fusion proteins were periplasmatically expressed in Escherichia coli. The binding properties were tested on PSMA-expressing C4-2 prostate cancer cells and CD3(+) Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. For in vitro functional analysis, a cell viability assay was used. T-cell activation was determined by flow cytometry. In vivo activity of the diabody was tested in SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing C4-2 tumor xenografts.

  RESULTS: Bacterial expression levels were significantly higher for the diabody (1-1.5 mg/l culture) compared with the single-chain diabody (0.2-0.4 mg/l culture). Specific binding on CD3-expressing Jurkat cells and PSMA-expressing C4-2 cells was shown with both diabody formats. In vitro, both diabodies proved to be potent agents for retargeting human CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes to lyse C4-2 prostate cancer cells. The formation of conjugates between T cells and target cells with clustering of the diabody at sites of interaction could be shown. SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing C4-2 tumor xenografts with the diabody showed an efficient inhibition of tumor growth.

  CONCLUSION: Both diabody formats showed a highly efficient and specific T cell-mediated killing of prostate cancer cells and are encouraging for further development in preclinical and clinical studies.

Abstract
  Although it is known that Escherichia coli O157 is capable of long-term soil survival, little is known about the mechanisms involved. This study investigated the role of the general stress response system RpoS in E.coli soil survival. The results showed that E.coli O157 isolates capable of long-term survival (longer than 200days) in manure-amended soil were characterized by the absence of mutations in their rpoS gene. In contrast, the strains not capable of long-term survival all possessed mutations in their rpoS gene. In addition, the long-term surviving strains showed significantly higher levels of acid resistance in simulated gastric fluid (pH 2.5). Sequencing of the rpoS gene of bovine, food and clinical isolates revealed a skewed distribution of rpoS wild-type and mutant strains among the different sources. Bovine and food isolates had low numbers of mutants (<1.4 and 6.9%, respectively), while a relatively high number of mutants was observed among human isolates (32.9%). The results indicate that a fully functional RpoS system is an advantage for survival in the manure-amended soil environment. Further deletion and complementation studies should provide more evidence on the role of RpoS in the long-term survival of E.coli O157 in diverse environments.  2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Abstract
  AIM: To retrospectively investigate the biochemical outcome following delayed radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 2000 to November 2008, 144 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer underwent radiotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy. Biochemical progression-free survival was compared in patients who began radiotherapy >6 months (delayed group) with these who began <= 6 months (non-delayed group) from diagnosis by biopsy. Treatment selection bias was adjusted by the propensity score method.

  RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 64 months, the 5-year biochemical progression-free survival of the delayed and non-delayed groups was 87.4% (95% confidence interval, CI=69.7-95.1%) and 96.6% (95% CI=89.6-98.9%), respectively (p=0.03). Delayed radiotherapy was the only independent risk factor for biochemical progression (hazard ratio=3.97, 95% CI 1.07-14.7, p=0.04). The results were validated by propensity score analysis.

  CONCLUSION: Delaying radiotherapy by >6 months increases the risk of biochemical progression in patients with localized prostate cancer.

Abstract
  Twelve pyridine analogs of curcumin were studied for their effects on growth and apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. The ability of these compounds to inhibit the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (phospho-ERK1/2) in PC-3 cells was also determined. Treatment of PC-3 cells with the pyridine analogs of curcumin resulted in concentration-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis stimulation. Only pyridine analogs of curcumin with a tetrahydrothiopyrane-4-one linker (FN compounds) exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on growth and a strong stimulatory effect on apoptosis at low concentrations (<= 1 uM). Mechanistic studies showed that NF-kB transcriptional activity in PC-3 cells was strongly inhibited by treatment with group FN compounds. Treatment of PC-3 cells with 1 uM FN1 resulted in a decrease of activated ERK1/2. Results from the present study indicate that FN compounds warrant further in vivo studies using suitable animal models of prostate cancer.

  Integrin 31 promotes tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion on laminin isoforms, and several clinical studies have indicated a correlation between increased tumoral 31 integrin expression and tumor progression, metastasis, and poor patient outcomes. However, several other clinical and experimental studies have suggested that 31 can possess anti-metastatic activity in certain settings. To help define the range of 31 functions in tumor cells in vivo, we used RNAi to silence the 3 integrin subunit in an aggressive, in vivo-passaged subline of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells. Loss of 3 integrin impaired adhesion and proliferation on the 31 integrin ligand, laminin-332 in vitro. Despite these deficits in vitro, the 3-silenced cells were significantly more aggressive in a lung colonization model in vivo, with a substantially increased rate of tumor growth that significantly reduced survival. In contrast, silencing the related 6 integrin subunit delayed metastatic growth in vivo. The increased colonization of 3-silenced tumor cells in vivo was recapitulated in 3D collagen co-cultures with lung fibroblasts or pre-osteoblast-like cells, where 3-silenced cells showed dramatically enhanced growth. The increased response of 3-silenced tumor cells to stromal cells in co-culture could be reproduced by fibroblast conditioned medium, which contains one or more heparin-binding factors that selectively favor the growth of 3-silenced cells. Our new data suggest a scenario in which 31 regulates tumor-host interactions within the metastatic tumor microenvironment to limit growth, providing some of the first direct evidence that specific loss of 3 function in tumor cells can have pro-metastatic consequences in vivo.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The G84E variant of HOXB13 was recently found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer in a case control study. We estimated the prevalence of this mutation in a clinical population of men at risk for prostate cancer who were scheduled to undergo prostate biopsy.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected clinical information and DNA samples from men who underwent diagnostic prostate biopsy between June 2005 and October 2011. We genotyped samples for HOXB13 G84E using the MassARRAY system. We determined the prevalence of the G84E variant in the overall cohort, among patients with a positive family history and among men age 55 years or younger.

  RESULTS: A total of 1,175 subjects underwent biopsy, of whom 948 had a DNA sample for analysis. The G84E variant was detected in 4 patients (prevalence 0.42%, 95% CI 0.12-1.08), of whom 3 had prostate cancer on biopsy. None of 301 patients with a positive family history (prevalence 0.00%, 95% CI 0.00-1.22) and 1 of 226 patients age 55 years or younger tested positive (prevalence 0.44%, 95% CI 0.01-2.44).

  CONCLUSIONS: The HOXB13 G84E variant is rare in this cohort, even among those with a positive family history. Our findings question the utility of testing for this variant among unselected men presenting for a diagnostic prostate biopsy.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The primary objective of the REDUCE (REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events) Follow-Up Study was to collect data on the occurrence of newly diagnosed prostate cancers for 2 years beyond the 4-year REDUCE study.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 4-year REDUCE study evaluated prostate cancer risk reduction in men taking dutasteride. This 2-year observational study followed men from REDUCE with a clinic visit shortly after study conclusion and with up to 2 annual telephone calls during which patient reported data were collected regarding prostate cancer events, chronic medication use, prostate specific antigen levels and serious adverse events. No study drug was provided and all biopsies during the 2-year followup were performed for cause. The primary objective was to collect data on the occurrence of new biopsy detectable prostate cancers. Secondary end points included assessment of Gleason score and serious adverse events.

  RESULTS: A total of 2,751 men enrolled in the followup study with numbers similar to those of the REDUCE former treatment groups (placebo and dutasteride). Few new prostate cancers were detected during the 2-year followup period in either former treatment group. A greater number of cancers were detected in the former dutasteride group than in the former placebo group (14 vs 7 cases). No Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancers were detected in either former treatment group based on central pathology review. No new safety issues were identified during the study.

  CONCLUSIONS: Two years of followup of the REDUCE study cohort demonstrated a low rate of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the former placebo and dutasteride treated groups. No new Gleason 8-10 cancers were detected. Copyright  2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is an oral anti-androgen commonly used to treat advanced prostate cancer. A variety of hepatotoxic reactions has been reported with CPA. Here we describe a case of a male patient who developed severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity during the treatment with CPA. The case, presenting sub-acute hepatitis, was characterized by a rapid evolution of cirrhosis and a protracted activity during the period of a few months despite the treatment withdrawal and an apparent benefits of corticosteroids, suggesting their indication in life threatening cases.

Abstract
  Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is commonly observed in human prostate cancer and is associated with therapeutic resistance. We have previously demonstrated that green tea polyphenols (GTP) induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells irrespective of p53 status. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations remain elusive. Here we investigated the mechanisms of GTP-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells stably-transfected with short hairpin-RNA against p53 (LNCaPshp53) and control vector (LNCaPshV). GTP treatment induced p53 stabilization and activation of downstream targets p21/waf1 and Bax in a dose-dependent manner specifically in LNCaPshV cells. However, GTP-induced FAS upregulation through activation of c-jun-N-terminal kinase resulted in FADD phosphorylation, caspase-8 activation and truncation of BID, leading to apoptosis in both LNCaPshV and LNCaPshp53 cells. In parallel, treatment of cells with GTP resulted in inhibition of survival pathway, mediated by Akt deactivation and loss of BAD phosphorylation more prominently in LNCaPshp53 cells. These distinct routes of cell death converged to a common pathway, leading to loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release and activation of terminal caspases, resulting in PARP-cleavage. GTP-induced apoptosis was attenuated with JNK inhibitor, SP600125 in both cell lines; whereas PI3K-Akt inhibitor, LY294002 resulted in increased cell death prominently in LNCaPshp53 cells, establishing the role of two distinct pathways of GTP-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, GTP exposure resulted in inhibition of class I HDAC protein, accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 in total cellular chromatin, resulting in increased accessibility of transcription factors to bind with the promoter sequences of p21/waf1 and Bax, regardless of the p53 status of cells, consistent with effects elicited by an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. These results demonstrate that GTP induces prostate cancer cell death by two distinct mechanisms regardless of p53 status, thus identifying specific well-defined molecular mechanisms that may be targeted by chemopreventive and/or therapeutic strategies.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is one of the major complications of type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM), leading to morbidity and mortality. Grape seed procyanidin B2 (GSPB2) has demonstrated protective effect against atherosclerosis, which is believed to be, at least in part, a result of its antioxidative effects. The aim of this study is to identify the target protein of GSPB2 responsible for the protective effect against atherosclerosis in patients with DM.

  METHODS AND RESULTS: GSPB2 (30 mg/kg body weight/day) were administrated to db/db mice for 10 weeks. Proteomics of the aorta extracts by iTRAQ analysis was obtained from db/db mice. The results showed that expression of 557 proteins were either up- or down-regulated in the aorta of diabetic mice. Among those proteins, 139 proteins were normalized by GSPB2 to the levels comparable to those in control mice. Among the proteins regulated by GSPB2, the milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-8 (MFG-E8) was found to be increased in serum level in T2DM patients; the serum level of MFG-E8 was positively correlated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV). Inhibition of MFG-E8 by RNA interference significantly suppressed whereas exogenous recombinant MFG-E8 administration exacerbated atherogenesis the db/db mice. To gain more insights into the mechanism of action of MFG-E8, we investigated the effects of MFG-E8 on the signal pathway involving the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Treatment with recombinant MFG-E8 led to increased whereas inhibition of MFG-E8 to decreased expression of MCP-1 and phosphorylation of ERK1/2.

  CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that MFG-E8 plays an important role in atherogenesis in diabetes through both ERK and MCP-1 signaling pathways. GSPB2, a well-studied antioxidant, significantly inhibited the arterial wall changes favoring atherogenesis in db/db mice by down-regulating MFG-E8 expression in aorta and its serum level. Measuring MFG-E8 serum level could be a useful clinical surrogate prognosticating atherogenesis in DM patients.

Abstract
  Colostrum contains cellular components that convey immunological protection to offspring. In the present study the main subsets of lymphocytes present in colostrum and in peripheral blood of healthy screened mothers were compared through the evaluation of >15 different flow cytometry markers. Colostrum and peripheral blood samples were collected within 3 days after full-term delivery. Flow cytometry assays and laboratory tests were performed soon after collection. Among B cells, percentages of CD19(+)CD5(+) cells, pertaining to natural immunity system, were significantly higher in colostrum than in peripheral blood (33 vs. 5%, p = 0.047). CD4(+) T cells, effector cells (CD45RA(+)/CD27(-)) and effector memory cells (CD45RA(-)/CD27(-)) were significantly higher in colostrum (p < 0.001) than in peripheral blood, as well as activated CD4(+) T cells (HLA(-)DR(+)) (36% vs. 6% p = 0.0022) and CD4(+) terminally differentiated effector T cells (CD57(+)) (p < 0.001). With regards to CD8(+) T cells, a comparable significant increase in effector (p < 0.02) and effector memory cells (p < 0.001) was also observed. Moreover, an increased surface expression of HLA-DR and CD57 (p < 0.001) on CD8(+) T cells in colostrum was detected. Colostrum contains a different distribution of lymphocyte subsets with respect to peripheral blood from mothers, confirming the observation that lymphocytes probably migrate in milk in a selective way. Colostrum T and B lymphocytes appear to be enriched with subsets possessing effector functions or belonging to the innate immune system, what could transfer a prompt line of defence to offspring.

Abstract
  Recent studies identifying putative truncated androgen receptor isoforms with ligand-independent activity have shed new light on the acquisition of androgen depletion independent (ADI) growth of prostate cancer. In this study, we present a model system in which a C-terminally truncated variant of androgen receptor (TC-AR) is inducibly expressed in LNCaP, an androgen-dependent cell line, which expresses little truncated receptor. We observed that when TC-AR is overexpressed, the endogenous full length receptor (FL-AR) is transcriptionally downmodulated. This in essence allows us to "replace" FL-AR with TC-AR and compare their individual properties in exactly the same genetic and cellular background, which has not been performed before. We show that the TC-AR translocates to the nucleus, activates transcription of AR target genes in the absence of DHT and is sufficient to confer ADI growth to the normally androgen dependent LNCaP line. We also show that while there is significant overlap in the genes regulated by FL- and TC-AR there are also differences in the respective suites of target genes with each AR form regulating genes that the other does not. Among the genes uniquely activated by TC-AR is RHOB which is shown to be involved in the increased migration and morphological changes observed in LN/TC-AR, suggesting a role of RHOB in the regulation of androgen-independent behavior of prostate cancer cells.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: During glutaminolysis, glutamine is catabolized to glutamate and incorporated into citric acid cycle and lipogenesis. Serum glutamate levels were measured in patients with primary prostate cancer or metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPCa) to establish clinical relevance. The effect of glutamate deprivation or blockade by metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) antagonists was investigated on prostate cancer cells' growth, migration, and invasion to establish biologic relevance.

  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum glutamate levels were measured in normal men (n = 60) and patients with primary prostate cancer (n = 197) or mCRPCa (n = 109). GRM1 expression in prostatic tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cell growth, migration, and invasion were determined using cell cytotoxicity and modified Boyden chamber assays, respectively. Apoptosis was detected using immunoblotting against cleaved caspases, PARP, and -H2AX.

  RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses showed significantly higher serum glutamate levels in Gleason score >= 8 than in the Gleason score <= 7 and in African Americans than in the Caucasian Americans. African Americans with mCRPCa had significantly higher serum glutamate levels than those with primary prostate cancer or benign prostate. However, in Caucasian Americans, serum glutamate levels were similar in normal research subjects and patients with mCRPC. IHC showed weak or no expression of GRM1 in luminal acinar epithelial cells of normal or hyperplastic glands but high expression in primary or metastatic prostate cancer tissues. Glutamate deprivation or blockade decreased prostate cancer cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion and led to apoptotic cell death.

  CONCLUSIONS: Glutamate expression is mechanistically associated with and may provide a biomarker of prostate cancer aggressiveness. 2012 AACR

Abstract
  Androgen activity plays a key role in prostate cancer progression. Androgen receptor (AR) is the main mediator of androgen activity in the prostate, through its ability to act as a transcription mediator. Here we performed a genome-wide analysis of human AR binding to promoters in the presence of an agonist or antagonist in an androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line. Many of the AR bound promoters are bound in all examined conditions while others are bound only in the presence of an agonist or antagonist. Several motifs are enriched in AR bound promoters, including the AR Response Element (ARE) half-site and recognition elements for the transcription factors OCT1 and SOX9. This suggests that these 3 factors could define a module of co-operating transcription factors in the prostate. Interestingly, AR bound promoters are preferentially located in AT rich genomic regions. Analysis of mRNA expression identified chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 1 (COUP-TF1) as a direct AR target gene that is downregulated upon binding by the agonist liganded AR. COUP-TF1 immunostaining revealed nucleolar localization of COUP-TF1 in epithelium of human androgen dependent prostate cancer, but not in adjacent benign prostate epithelium. Stromal cells both in human and mouse prostate show nuclear COUP-TF1 staining. We further show that there is an inverse correlation between COUP-TF1 expression in prostate stromal cells and the rising levels of androgen with advancing puberty. This study extends the pool of recognized putative AR targets and identifies a negatively regulated target of AR - COUP-TF1 - which could possibly play a role in human prostate cancer.

Abstract
  The aims of this study were to: (1) determine whether replacement of cow's milk protein with soy resolves Chronic Functional Constipation (CFC); and (2) investigate the effects of cow's milk  casein A1 and cow's milk  casein A2 on CFC. Children diagnosed with CFC were recruited to one of two crossover trials: Trial 1 compared the effects of cow's milk and soy milk; Trial 2 compared the effects of cow's milk  casein A1 and cow's milk  casein A2. Resolution of constipation was defined as greater than eight bowel motions during a two week intervention. Thirteen children (18 to 144 months) participated in Trial 1 (6 boys, 7 girls). Nine participants who completed the soy epoch all experienced resolution (p < 0.05). Thirty-nine children (21 to 144 months) participated in Trial 2 (25 boys, 14 girls). Resolution of constipation was highest during the washout epoch, 81%; followed by cow's milk  casein A2, 79%; and cow's milk  casein A1, 57%; however, the proportions did not differ statistically. The results of Trial 1 demonstrate an association between CFC and cow's milk consumption but Trial 2 failed to show an effect from type of casein. Some other component in cow's milk common to both A1 and A2 milk may be causing a problem in these susceptible children.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Recurrent aphthous ulcerations (RAU), or recurrent aphthous stomatitis, is recognized as one of the most common oral mucosal diseases worldwide. It was noted some connection between immunity to cow's milk proteins (CMP) and oral diseases. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of the increased levels of serum antibodies to specific cow's milk proteins (SCMP), constituents of cheese or of whey, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, in subjects who have RAU.

  METHODS: Fifty subjects with RAU and 50 healthy people, as controls (C), were included in this research. Levels of serum IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies to SCMP were determined by ELISA. The statistical analysis of data was performed by Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction.

  RESULTS: The levels of serum anti-SCMP IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies were significantly higher in subjects with RAU in comparison with controls (P < 0.005).

  CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the strong association between high levels of serum anti-SCMP IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies, especially to caseins: -, -, and k-casein from cow's milk and clinical manifestations of RAU. Serum immunity to the whey proteins in subjects with RAU was not in so high percentage expressed.  2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Abstract
  Retinoids constitute a family of organic compounds that are being used for the treatment of various diseases, ranging from acne vulgaris to acute promyelocytic leukemia. Their use however is limited due to serious adverse effects and there is a great need for analogues with better safety profile. In the present work, the effect of N(1),N(12)-bis(all-trans-retinoyl)spermine (RASP), a conjugate of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) with spermine, on angiogenesis in vivo and viability of human endothelial and prostate cancer cells in vitro were studied. Both atRA and RASP dose-dependently inhibited angiogenesis in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. RASP was more effective and could be used in a wider dose range due to lower toxicity compared with atRA. Both retinoids decreased the number of human umbilical vein endothelial and prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. RASP was more effective and potent compared with atRA, spermine, their combination, or conjugates of spermine with other acidic retinoids and/or psoralens in prostate cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of both atRA and RASP seems to be related to an increase of the tumour repressing gene retinoic acid receptor beta mRNA, was mediated by retinoic acid receptor alpha, and was proportional to endogenous retinoic acid receptor beta expression. These data suggest that RASP is more effective than atRA in decreasing angiogenesis and prostate cancer cell growth and identify retinoic acid receptor alpha as the receptor through which it causes retinoic acid receptor beta up-regulation and decrease of prostate cancer cell growth.

Abstract
  When the prostate cancer cells become unresponsive to androgen therapy, resistance to chemotherapy becomes imminent, resulting in high mortality. To combat this situation, lycopodine, a pharmacologically important bioactive component derived from Lycopodium clavatum spores, was tested against hormone sensitive (LnCaP) and refractory (PC3) prostate cancer cells in vitro. This study aims to check if lycopodine has demonstrable anti-cancer effects and if it has, to find out the possible mechanism of its action. The MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect. Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle, EGF receptor activity and apoptosis were recorded by FACS; profiles of different anti- and pro-apoptotic genes and their products were studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, indirect-ELISA, western blotting. Drug-DNA interaction was determined by CD spectroscopy. Administration of lycopodine down-regulated the expression of 5-lipoxygenase and the 5-oxo-ETE receptor (OXE receptor1) and EGF receptor, and caused up-regulation of cytochrome c with depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential, without palpable change in p53 activity, resulting in apoptosis, cell arrest at G0/G1 stage and ultimately reduced proliferation of cancer cells; concomitantly, there was externalization of phosphotidyl serine residues. CD spectroscopic analysis revealed intercalating property of lycopodine with DNA molecule, implicating its ability to block cellular DNA synthesis. The overall results suggest that lycopodine is a promising candidate suitable for therapeutic use as an anti-cancer drug. Copyright  2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The redox-silent vitamin E analog -tocopheryl succinate (-TOS) was found to synergistically cooperate with vitamin K3 (VK3) plus ascorbic acid (AA) in the induction of cancer cell-selective apoptosis via a caspase-independent pathway. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism(s) underlying cell death induced in prostate cancer cells by -TOS, VK3 and AA, and the potential use of targeted drug combination in the treatment of prostate cancer.

  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The generation of ROS, cellular response to oxidative stress, and autophagy were investigated in PC3 prostate cancer cells by using drugs at sub-toxic doses. We evaluated whether PARP1-mediated apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release plays a role in apoptosis induced by the combination of the agents. Next, the effect of the combination of -TOS, VK3 and AA on tumor growth was examined in nude mice. VK3 plus AA induced early ROS formation associated with induction of autophagy in response to oxidative stress, which was reduced by -TOS, preventing the formation of autophagosomes. -TOS induced mitochondrial destabilization leading to the release of AIF. Translocation of AIF from mitochondria to the nucleus, a result of the combinatorial treatment, was mediated by PARP1 activation. The inhibition of AIF as well as of PARP1 efficiently attenuated apoptosis triggered by the drug combination. Using a mouse model of prostate cancer, the combination of -TOS, VK3 and AA was more efficient in tumor suppression than when the drugs were given separately, without deleterious side effects.

  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: -TOS, a mitochondria-targeting apoptotic agent, switches at sub-apoptotic doses from autophagy-dependent survival of cancer cells to their demise by promoting the induction of apoptosis. Given the grim prognosis for cancer patients, this finding is of potential clinical relevance.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Tetrameric (2)-macroglobulin ((2)M), a plasma panproteinase inhibitor, is activated upon interaction with a proteinase, and undergoes a major conformational change exposing a receptor recognition site in each of its subunits. Activated (2)M ((2)M*) binds to cancer cell surface GRP78 and triggers proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling. We have studied the role of (2)M* in the regulation of mTORC1 and TORC2 signaling in the growth of human prostate cancer cells.

  METHODS: Employing immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blotting as well as kinase assays, activation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, as well as down stream targets were studied. RNAi was also employed to silence expression of Raptor, Rictor, or GRP78 in parallel studies.

  RESULTS: Stimulation of cells with (2)M* promotes phosphorylation of mTOR, TSC2, S6-Kinase, 4EBP, Akt(T308), and Akt(S473) in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Rheb, Raptor, and Rictor also increased. (2)M* treatment of cells elevated mTORC1 kinase activity as determined by kinase assays of mTOR or Raptor immunoprecipitates. mTORC1 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and rapamycin or transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA. Down regulation of Raptor expression by RNAi significantly reduced (2)M*-induced S6-Kinase phosphorylation at T389 and kinase activity in Raptor immunoprecipitates. (2)M*-treated cells demonstrate about a twofold increase in mTORC2 kinase activity as determined by kinase assay of Akt(S473) phosphorylation and levels of p-Akt(S473) in mTOR and Rictor immunoprecipitates. mTORC2 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA, but insensitive to rapamycin. Down regulation of Rictor expression by RNAi significantly reduces (2)M*-induced phosphorylation of Akt(S473) phosphorylation in Rictor immunoprecipitates.

  CONCLUSION: Binding of (2)M* to prostate cancer cell surface GRP78 upregulates mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation and promotes protein synthesis in the prostate cancer cells.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer is the most frequent and second most lethal cancer in men in the United States. Innate immunity and inflammation may increase the risk of prostate cancer. To determine the role of innate immunity and inflammation in advanced prostate cancer, we investigated the association of 320 single nucleotide polymorphisms, located in 46 genes involved in this pathway, with disease risk using 494 cases with advanced disease and 536 controls from Cleveland, Ohio. Taken together, the whole pathway was associated with advanced prostate cancer risk (P=0.02). Two sub-pathways (intracellular antiviral molecules and extracellular pattern recognition) and four genes in these sub-pathways (TLR1, TLR6, OAS1, and OAS2) were nominally associated with advanced prostate cancer risk and harbor several SNPs nominally associated with advanced prostate cancer risk. Our results suggest that the innate immunity and inflammation pathway may play a modest role in the etiology of advanced prostate cancer through multiple small effects.

Abstract
  L-Lysine (L-Lys) is an essential amino acid that plays fundamental roles in protein synthesis. Many nuclear phosphorylated proteins such as Stat5 and mTOR regulate milk protein synthesis. However, the details of milk protein synthesis control at the transcript and translational levels are not well known. In this current study, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)/MS-based proteomic technology was used to identify phosphoproteins responsible for milk protein synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells (DCMECs). The effect of L-Lys on DCMECs was analyzed by CASY technology and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that cell proliferation ability and -casein expression were enhanced in DCMECs treated with L-Lys. By phosphoproteomics analysis, six proteins, including MAPK1, were identified up-expressed in DCMECs treated with 1.2 mM L-Lys for 24 h, and were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Overexpression and siRNA inhibition of MAPK1 experiments showed that MAPK1 upregulated milk protein synthesis through Stat5 and mTOR pathway. These findings that MAPK1 involves in regulation of milk synthesis shed new insights for understanding the mechanisms of milk protein synthesis.

Abstract
  Intratumoural steroidogenesis may play a significant role in the progression of prostate cancer (PC) in the context of long-term ablation of circulating testosterone (T). To clarify the mechanism accounting for the progression of PC in a 74-year-old man who had undergone bilateral orchiectomy when he was 5years old, we performed immunohistochemical studies of androgen receptor (AR) and steroidogenic enzymes in the prostate. We also measured steroid hormone levels in the serum and prostate, as well as mRNA levels of genes mediating androgen metabolism in the prostate. Positive nuclear staining of AR was detected in malignant epithelial cells. The levels of androstenedione (Adione), T, and 5-alpha dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the serum of the patient were similar to those in PC patients receiving neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but were higher in the patient's prostate than in PC patients not receiving ADT. The gene expression of CYP17A1 and HSD3B1 was not detected, whereas that of STS, HSD3B2, AKR1C3, SRD5A1, and SRD5A2 was detected. Moreover, cytoplasmic staining of HSD3B2, AKR1C3, SRD5A1, and SRD5A2 was detected in malignant epithelial cells. Hence, in the present case (a man with primary hypogonadism), steroidogenesis in PC tissues from adrenal androgens, especially dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, was the mechanism accounting for progression of PC. This mechanism might help elucidate the development of castration-resistant PC.  2012 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.

Abstract
  The CD36 molecule plays a pivotal role in a variety of immunological and cellular processes, including pathogen recognition, inflammation and apoptosis. Herein, we demonstrate that this gene is duplicated in goats, with two copies (CD36 and CD36-like) that display highly divergent mRNA expression profiles. In this way, CD36 mRNA is mostly expressed in the adipose tissue and heart whilst CD36-like mRNA shows a high expression in the liver. We have also found evidence of the presence of two paralogous CD36 and CD36-like genes in the bovine genome, suggesting that CD36 duplication took place before goat-cattle radiation, i.e. at least 20 MYR ago. Finally, we have characterized the polymorphism of the coding regions of the goat CD36 and CD36-like genes. In doing so, we have identified one synonymous polymorphism at the CD36-like gene (c.390A>C) that displays a significant association (P=0.04) with milk somatic cell count, a parameter often used to diagnose mastitis in domestic ruminants.

Abstract
  Celecoxib is a clinically available COX-2 inhibitor that has been reported to have antineoplastic activity. It has been proposed as a preventative agent for several types of early neoplastic lesions. Earlier studies have shown that sensitivity of prostatic carcinoma (PCa) to celecoxib is associated with apoptosis; however, these studies have not demonstrated adequately whether this effect is dependent on p53 status. We studied the relation between sensitivity to celecoxib and the phenotypic p53 status of PCa cells lines, LNCaP (wild type p53), PC3 (null p53) and DU145 (mutated p53). Cellular growth was assessed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after celecoxib treatment at concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 100 uM using an MTT assay. Cellular proliferation (Ki-67 expression) was determined by immunocytochemistry. Phenotypic expression of p53 was analyzed by western blotting. The effects of celecoxib on cellular growth and its association with p53 were assessed after down-regulation of p53 using synthetic interfering RNAs (siRNA) in LNCaP cells. Expression of p53 and COX-2 at mRNA levels was assessed by quantitative real time polymerase reaction (qRT-PCR). We found that celecoxib inhibited cellular growth and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines; LNCaP cells with a native p53 were the most sensitive to celecoxib. We observed a down- regulation effect on p53 in LNCaP cells exposed to >= 30 uM celecoxib for 72 h, but found no significant changes in the p53 levels of DU145 cells, which have a mutated p53. Reduced COX-2 expression was found with decreased p53 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells that were exposed to >= 20 uM of celecoxib for 72 h, but COX-2 expression was increased in DU145 cells. All three cell lines demonstrated pan-cytotoxicity when exposed to 100 uM celecoxib. When p53 expression was inhibited using siRNA in LNCaP cells, the inhibitory effects on cellular growth usually exerted by celecoxib were not changed significantly. Celecoxib reduces the growth of prostate cancer cell lines in part by decreasing proliferation, which suggests that the inhibition of growth of LNCaP cells by celecoxib is independent of normal levels of native p53.

Abstract
  While associations between trace elements and heavy metals with prostate cancer are still debatable, they have been considered as risk factors for prostate cancer. Thus, this study aimed to detect any links between selected minerals and heavy metals including Se, Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe with prostate cancer. A case control study was carried out among 100 subjects (case n=50, control n=50), matched for age and ethnicity. Trace elements and heavy metals level in hair and nail samples were determined by ICP-MS. Mean selenium levels in hair and nail of the cases were significantly lower as compared to controls. A similar trend was noted for zinc in both hair and nail samples, whereas the mean level of copper was significantly higher in cases than controls. Similar elevation was noted for iron and manganese (p<0.05 for all parameters). Low levels of selenium and zinc and high levels of copper, iron and manganese appear to be associated with the risk of prostate cancer. Further studies to elucidate the causal mechanisms and appropriate chemopreventive measures are needed.

Abstract
  Prolactin is essential for normal mammary gland development and differentiation, and has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic resistance. Soluble isoforms of the prolactin receptor (PrlR) have been reported to regulate prolactin bioavailability by functioning as 'prolactin-binding proteins'. Included in this category is 7/11, a product of alternate splicing of the PrlR primary transcript. However, the direct interactions of prolactin with 7/11, and the resulting effect on cell behavior, have not been investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the ability of 7/11 to bind prolactin using a novel proximity ligation assay and traditional immunoprecipitation techniques. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that 7/11 was heavily glycosylated, similar to the extracellular domain of the primary PrlR, and that glycosylation regulated the cellular localization and secretion of 7/11. Low levels of 7/11 were detected in serum samples of healthy volunteers, but were undetectable in human milk samples. Expression of 7/11 was also detected in six of the 62 primary breast tumor biopsies analyzed; however, no correlation was found with 7/11 expression and tumor histotype or other patient demographics. Functional analysis demonstrated the ability of 7/11 to inhibit prolactin-induced cell proliferation as well as alter prolactin-induced rescue of cell cycle arrest/early senescence events in breast epithelial cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that 7/11 is a novel regulatory mechanism of prolactin bioavailability and signaling.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: A few studies have reported that the quantity of selected cytokines/chemokines in breast milk might be associated with atopic dermatitis (AD). Using the multiplex cytokine assay system, we examined cytokines/chemokines in human milk in order to identify new biomarkers related to AD.

  METHODS: We recruited 49 infants with or without AD who participated in a birth cohort and measured the concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in the colostrum (collected within 4-5 days after birth) and mature milk (collected at 1 month postpartum) received by the infants.

  RESULTS: There were significant differences in the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-12p40 in the colostrum, and in those of IL-4, eotaxin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-2 and MIP-1 in the mature milk between the milk received by infants who developed AD at the age of 6 months and that received by the control infants. There was weak to moderate correlation between those 6 cytokines/chemokines in mature milk. Atopic history and IgE levels of mothers were not related to cytokine/chemokine concentrations in breast milk. Logistic regression analyses showed that high levels of eotaxin in the mature milk were a risk for the development of AD at 6 months of age.

  CONCLUSION: These results suggest that several cytokines/chemokines, especially eotaxin, are potential biomarkers for development of AD in early infancy. Copyright  2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  Bronchial-associated immune development is critically important to protect neonates from respiratory infections. Herein, bronchial-associated immune development in formula-fed and sow-reared pigs is described. Colostrum-fed newborn piglets were fed medicated sow milk replacer formula beginning at 48 h of life or remained with the sow. Blood and tissues were sampled at one-week (d7) and three-weeks (d21) of age. Lymphocyte subpopulations, including T helper 2, cytotoxic T, memory T, and NK cells, in peripheral blood, mediastinal lymph nodes, and thoracic lymph nodes were identified using flow cytometry. Additionally, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, TNF, TGF-1, TGF-2, IFN, IFN, and dectin gene expression were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Total IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations in serum were analyzed. Dietary and developmental effects were observed. This set of baseline measurements provides a framework for future respiratory challenge studies where the effects of diet on the neonate's ability to resist and/or recover from infection can be tested.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammation marker, is prognostic in several cancers. We assessed the association between the pretreatment NLR and outcome of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with the CYP17 inhibitor ketoconazole.

  METHODS: This was an international, retrospective study of 156 mCRPC patients treated with ketoconazole. The independent effect of the pretreatment NLR and factors associated with treatment outcome were determined by multivariate analysis.

  RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (50%) had a >=50% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 8 months. Excluded from the analysis were 23 patients without available data on their NLR and those with a recent health event or treatment associated with a blood count change. Sixty-two patients (47%) had a pretreatment NLR >3. Risk factors associated with the PFS outcome were a pretreatment NLR >3 and PSA doubling time (PSADT) <3 months and a prior response to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist of <24 months or to an antiandrogen of <6 months. The number of risk factors was used to form a predictive nomogram by patient categorization into favorable (zero or one factor), intermediate (two factors), and poor (three or four factors) risk groups.

  CONCLUSIONS: In mCRPC patients treated with ketoconazole, the pretreatment NLR and PSADT, and prior response to androgen-deprivation therapy, may be associated with the PFS time and used to form a risk stratification predictive nomogram.

Abstract
  In mice, during late pregnancy and lactation, maternal precursors of IgA-containing cells (cIgA-cells) are primed in the gut and home to the mammary gland where they secrete IgA. In turn, the ensuing increase in milk IgA mediates immune protection of the newborn gastrointestinal tract. PRM/Alf is an inbred mouse strain which exhibits a substantial post-natal intestinal lengthening which develops throughout the neonatal suckling period, suggesting that the availability of cIg-A cells and the level of protective IgA in milk might also be increased. We confirmed that PRM/Alf milk contains higher amounts of IgA than C57BL/6J throughout lactation, concomitantly with an increase of pIgR on epithelial cells and a higher density of cIgA-cells in the PRM/Alf mammary gland. Furthermore, a search for variations in cellular and humoral factors implicated in regulating cIgA-cell migration towards the mammary gland, including the vascular addressins MAdCAM-1 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) as well as the mucosal epithelial chemokine CCL28, did not reveal any quantitative differences in expression between PRM/Alf and C57BL/6J mice strains. Thus our results indicate that these factors are not limiting in the recruitment of cIgA-cells released from the elongated gut of PRM/Alf mice. In the context of intestinal lengthening, these findings strengthen the notion of an entero-mammary gland link, where the neonatal gut is protected by the maternal gut through the immune function of the mammary gland.

Abstract
  Recent years, the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer have increased dramatically in China. At earlier stages, most diagnosed prostate cancers are responsive to androgen depletion treatment, yet, nearly all patients will eventually progress to metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC), which still has no effective therapeutic method or drug to deal with. 11'-Deoxyverticillin A (C42) belongs to the family of epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs), an interesting class of fungal toxins that inhibit farnesyl transferase. Compounds holding such a property have been explored as putative anticancer agents. In this study, using PC3M cells, an AIPC cell line, we investigated the effect of the compound on apoptosis and explored the underlying mechanism. It revealed that C42 markedly enhanced the activity of caspase-3/7 and increased the accumulation of the cleaved PARP, all of which are the markers of apoptosis. It also revealed that C42 either decreased cell viability or inhibited the growth of PC3M cells. Moreover, we observed that the loss of cell viability and cell growth inhibition induced by C42 were both time- and dosage dependent. Taken together, we indicated that C42 can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in AIPC cells, and the results presented here will broaden our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which C42 exerts its anticancer activity, and future work in this direction may provide valuable information in the development of these compounds into effective cancer therapeutic strategies against androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Abstract
  The influence of photoperiod manipulation in the dry period was examined in dairy goats experiencing environmental heat stress. Multiparous Israeli Saanen goats were blocked at dry off (~60 d prepartum) into 2 groups of 4 goats each based on body weight, previous milk production, and detected embryo number. Treatments consisted of long-day (16 h light:8 h dark) and short-day (8 h light:16 h dark) photoperiods (LDPP and SDPP, respectively). Heat-stress conditions were applied by manipulating the environment of metabolic rooms to reach a maximum temperature of 37C between 1000 and 2200 h, and a minimum of 23C and 70.3% relative humidity. All goats were returned to ambient photoperiod after kidding, milked twice daily, and milk yield was automatically recorded. Dry matter intake during the dry period was similar between treatments, averaging 1,114 g/d. Milk production was significantly higher in the SDPP than the LDPP group (2,172 vs. 1,550 g/d) during the 12-wk experimental period. Milk protein and fat contents were similar in both groups and averaged 3.63 and 4.34%, respectively, whereas milk lactose was higher in the LDPP group (4.77 vs. 4.67%). Heart rates were similar between treatments and averaged 112.6 beats per minute (BPM). Respiration rates were lower in the morning (58.4 BPM) compared with the afternoon (91.2 BPM) and were not influenced by photoperiod. Rectal temperature was higher for the LDPP than the SDPP group (40.4 vs. 39.6C). The thyroid hormone level (mean +/- SE) was similar in both groups during the dry period, but higher during lactation in the LDPP goats up to 40 d postpartum (110+/-6.59 vs. 156+/-8.76 ng/mL). Plasma IGF-1 (mean +/- SE) was higher in the LDPP group (279+/-62 vs. 162+/-27 ng/mL in SDPP) during the dry period but was similar postkidding, averaging 132+/-24 ng/mL. Plasma prolactin level (mean +/- SE) was higher in the LDPP than the SDPP group during the dry period (17.2+/-1.6 vs. 10.6+/-0.99 ng/mL), whereas it was similar throughout lactation (0.61+/-0.28 ng/mL). These data support the idea that SDPP manipulation during heat load in dry goats can be used as an abatement strategy to reduce the carryover effect of heat stress observed during the subsequent lactation. The higher milk production in SDPP goats is explained by changes in circulating prolactin profile rather than differences in feed intake or secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1.

Abstract
  An experiment was conducted to quantify the changes in energy partitioning resulting from grain supplementation in herbage-fed dairy cows at 4 stages during a 670-d lactation. The experiment used 16 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows, with a control and a grain treatment being randomly allocated to 8 cows each. During 4 measurement periods (each of 4d in a metabolism stall and 3d in an indirect calorimeter) beginning at approximately 110, 270, 450, and 560 d in milk (DIM), the energy balance of each cow was measured. Cows in both groups were individually offered freshly cut ryegrass pasture (Lolium hybridum L.) in periods 1 and 3 and ryegrass pasture silage and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay in periods 2 and 4. In all periods, cows in the grain group were offered an additional 4.4 to 5.0 kg of dry matter of cereal grain/cow per day. Adding grain to the diet increased yields of fat and protein and tended to increase yields of milk and lactose, but did not affect milk composition. Gross energy intake (GEI) declined as lactation progressed. Adding grain to the diet decreased the percentage of GEI in feces and urine, but the extent of these reductions did not change as lactation progressed. Adding grain to the diet similarly reduced the percentage of GEI lost to heat, but again the extent of the reduction remained similar as lactation progressed. The magnitude of the increase in milk energy resulting from grain supplementation did not change with advancing lactation, but tissue energy retention was greater in the first 300 DIM compared with after 300 DIM. For herbage-based diets, CH(4) emissions ranged from 6.2 to 7.6% of GEI, which corresponds to 24.0 to 25.8 g of CH(4)/kg of dry matter intake. For diets supplemented with cereal grains, CH(4) emissions ranged from 6.3 to 7.3% of GEI, which corresponds to 21.6 to 25.2 g of CH(4)/kg of dry matter intake. It was concluded that, for cows producing <24 kg of milk/d and consuming herbage-based diets supplemented with grain, the efficiency of utilizing the additional energy in the grain, as measured by the loss of energy in heat, and its partitioning to milk, did not change as lactation progressed from 110 to 560 DIM.

Abstract
  In cattle, at least 39 variants of the 4 casein proteins ((S1)-, -, (S2)- and k-casein) have been described to date. Many of these variants are known to affect milk-production traits, cheese-processing properties, and the nutritive value of milk. They also provide valuable information for phylogenetic studies. So far, the majority of studies exploring the genetic variability of bovine caseins considered European taurine cattle breeds and were carried out at the protein level by electrophoretic techniques. This only allows the identification of variants that, due to amino acid exchanges, differ in their electric charge, molecular weight, or isoelectric point. In this study, the open reading frames of the casein genes CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN1S2, and CSN3 of 356 animals belonging to 14 taurine and 3 indicine cattle breeds were sequenced. With this approach, we identified 23 alleles, including 5 new DNA sequence variants, with a predicted effect on the protein sequence. The new variants were only found in indicine breeds and in one local Iranian breed, which has been phenotypically classified as a taurine breed. A multidimensional scaling approach based on available SNP chip data, however, revealed an admixture of taurine and indicine populations in this breed as well as in the local Iranian breed Golpayegani. Specific indicine casein alleles were also identified in a few European taurine breeds, indicating the introgression of indicine breeds into these populations. This study shows the existence of substantial undiscovered genetic variability of bovine casein loci, especially in indicine cattle breeds. The identification of new variants is a valuable tool for phylogenetic studies and investigations into the evolution of the milk protein genes. Copyright  2013 American Dairy Science Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Premature infants fed formula are more likely to develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) than those who are breastfed, but the mechanisms of intestinal necrosis in NEC and protection by breast milk are unknown. We hypothesized that after lipase digestion, formula, but not fresh breast milk, contains levels of unbound free fatty acids (FFAs) that are cytotoxic to intestinal cells.

  METHODS: We digested multiple term and preterm infant formulas or human milk with pancreatic lipase, proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), lipase + proteases, or luminal fluid from a rat small intestine and tested FFA levels and cytotoxicity in vitro on intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and neutrophils.

  RESULTS: Lipase digestion of formula, but not milk, caused significant death of neutrophils (ranging from 47 to 99% with formulas vs. 6% with milk) with similar results in endothelial and epithelial cells. FFAs were significantly elevated in digested formula vs. milk and death from formula was significantly decreased with lipase inhibitor pretreatment, or treatments to bind FFAs. Protease digestion significantly increased FFA binding capacity of formula and milk but only enough to decrease cytotoxicity from milk.

  CONCLUSION: FFA-induced cytotoxicity may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC.

Abstract
  Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) is a transmembrane transport protein found in many cell types and is involved in substrate-specific transport of endogenous and exogenous substrates. Recently, it has shown to be expressed in prostate cancer cell lines and to be among the most commonly upregulated transcripts in prostate cancer, although a comprehensive expression analysis is lacking so far. We aimed to investigate its expression by immunohistochemistry in a larger cohort of neoplastic and nonneoplastic prostate tissues (n=441) and to correlate its expression with clinicopathological parameters including PSA-free survival times and molecular correlates of androgen signaling (androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and forkhead box A (FoxA)). MRP4 is widely expressed in benign and neoplastic prostate epithelia, but its expression gradually decreases during tumor progression towards castrate-resistant disease. Concordantly, it correlated with conventional prognosticators of disease progression and-within the group of androgen-dependent tumors-with AR and FoxA expression. Moreover, lower levels of MRP4 expression were associated with shorter PSA relapse-free survival times in the androgen-dependent group. In benign tissues, we found zone-dependent differences of MRP4 expression, with the highest levels in the peripheral and central zones. Although MRP4 is known to be regulated in prostate cancer, this study is the first to demonstrate a gradual downregulation of MRP4 protein during malignant tumor progression and a prognostic value of this loss of expression.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess whether oestrogen-regulated gene (ERG) expression analysis using GeneChip arrays can predict transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-ERG fusion. The expression level of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene was studied in various histological grades of prostate cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CPRC).

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: GeneChip Affymetrix exon 1.0 ST arrays were used for expression profiling of ERG, erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) variant gene 1 (ETV1), ETV4 and ETV5 genes in 67 prostate cancer tissue specimens. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and in some cases DNA sequencing was used to validate the presence and the expression levels of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions.

  RESULTS: In our series of patients with prostate cancer over expression of the ERG gene predicted the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements in almost all cases. ETS expression by itself outmatched the diagnostic performance of the ERG exons ratioing allowing equal detection of the less frequent ETS gene fusion transcripts. The gene fusions were expressed at significantly lower levels in CPRC but occurred more frequently than in primary prostate cancer.

  CONCLUSIONS: ERG expression analysis using GeneChip arrays appears to be an excellent diagnostic tool for identifying gene rearrangements. In coming years, measuring expression of the ETS gene family by itself might become a clinically relevant surrogate test to identify patients with fusion-positive prostate cancer. The variation of gene fusion expression levels, particularly in CPRC, needs to be taken into account when using quantitative molecular diagnosis of prostate cancer.  2013 BJU International.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been associated with an increased risk of skeletal-associated complications, such as a decrease in bone mineral density and an increase in fracture risk. Many men with pre-existing health conditions receive ADT as their primary treatment because they are considered to be inappropriate candidates for attempted curative treatments. However, several chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, rheumatoid disease and chronic liver disease, are strong predictors for osteoporosis and fractures. We undertook the present study aiming to quantify the impact of treating men with ADT who carry known risk factors for skeletal complications. Among these high-risk men, more than 58% develop at least one fracture after ADT within the 12 years of follow-up. Men who sustained a fracture within 48 months experienced an almost 40% higher risk of mortality than those who did not. Our findings suggest that treating men with a high fracture risk at baseline with long-term ADT may have serious adverse consequences.

  OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications and evaluate the risk of mortality after a fracture.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 75994 men, aged >= 66 years, with localized prostate cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked data. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to evaluate the risk.

  RESULTS: Men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications have a higher probability of receiving ADT than those with a low risk (52.1% vs 38.2%, P < 0.001). During the 12-year follow-up, more than 58% of men with a high risk and 38% of men with a low risk developed at least one fracture after ADT. The dose effect of ADT is stronger among men who received ADT only compared to those who received ADT with other treatments. In the high-risk group, the fracture rate increased by 19.9 per 1000 person-years (from 52.9 to 73.0 person-years) for men who did not receive ADT compared to those who received 18 or more doses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist among men who received ADT only, and by 14.2 per 1000 person-years (from 45.2 to 59.4 person-years) among men who received ADT and other treatments. Men experiencing a fracture had a 1.38-fold higher overall mortality risk than those who did not (95% CI, 1.34-1.43).

  CONCLUSIONS: Men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications developed more fractures after ADT. The mortality risk is 40% higher after experiencing a fracture. Consideration of patient risk before prescribing ADT for long-term use may reduce both fracture risk and fracture-associated mortality.  2013 BJU International.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: To date, only a few studies have addressed the long-term oncological outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with pathological Gleason score >= 8 prostate cancer. According to these reports, some individuals with pathological Gleason score >= 8 may benefit from RP, with cancer-control outcomes comparable with those of patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The presence of pathological Gleason score 8-10 represents a poor prognostic factor in the outcome of men with prostate cancer. However, in patients with specimen-confined disease, RP and bilateral PLND provided long-term cancer-control outcomes similar to those of patients with more favourable disease characteristics.

  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcomes of patients with pathological Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer subjected to radical prostatectomy (RP). To determine the prognostic factors associated with cancer-specific survival (CSS) in this subset of patients.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 580 consecutive patients with pathological Gleason sum 8-10 prostate cancer treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at a single European institution between July 1988 and April 2010. All patients had detailed pathological and follow-up data. Pathological Gleason score was determined by a single expert genitourinary pathologist. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined PSA concentration of >= 0.2 ng/mL and rising. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to graphically explore BCR-free survival as well as CSS and overall survival (OS) rates. Moreover, univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to test the predictors of CSS.

  RESULTS: The mean (median, range) age at surgery was 66.1 (66.4, 41-85) years. The mean (median, range) total PSA concentration was 29.6 (11.1, 0.5-1710) ng/mL. Pathological Gleason score was 8 in 238 (41.0%), 9 in 330 (56.9%) and 10 in 12 (2.1%) patients. Overall, 119 (20.5%), 124 (21.4%), 281 (48.4%) and 56 (9.7%) patients had pT2, pT3a, pT3b and pT4 prostate cancer, respectively. Overall, 275 (47.4%) had LN invasion, while 150 (25.1%) patients had specimen-confined disease (defined as pT2cR0 pN0 or pT3aR0 pN0 prostate cancer). The mean (median, range) follow-up was 53 (47, 1-226) months. At 5 and 10 years after RP, BCR-free survival was 76.7% and 49.6%, respectively. Similarly, the 5- and 10-year CSS rates were 87.3% and 69.5%, respectively. Patients with specimen-confined disease (P < 0.001) and patients with negative LNs (P = 0.012) had significantly better CSS rates than their counterparts with less favourable pathological characteristics. In multivariable Cox regression models, only the presence of specimen-confined disease achieved independent predictor status (P = 0.001).

  CONCLUSION: Presence of high Gleason score at RP represents a poor prognostic factor in the outcome of patients with prostate cancer. However, RP provides excellent long-term cancer control outcomes in the subset of patients with specimen-confined disease.  2012 The Authors. BJU International  2012 BJU International.

Abstract
  Several studies have observed decreased levels of lipophilic antioxidants after supplementation with phytosterols and stanols. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of phytosterol supplementation on plasma total antioxidant capacity in patients with metabolic syndrome. In a parallel arm, randomized placebo-controlled design, 108 patients with metabolic syndrome were assigned to consume yogurt beverage which provided 4 g of phytosterols per day or yogurt beverage without phytosterols. The duration of the study was 2 months and the patients in both groups followed their habitual westernized type diet. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 2 months, and the total antioxidant capacity of plasma was measured using the ferric reducing antioxidant power of plasma and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays. After 2 months of intervention, plasma total antioxidant capacity did not differ between and within the intervention and the control groups. Phytosterol supplementation does not affect plasma antioxidant status.

Abstract
  The methanol extract of dried fruits of Odyendyea gabonensis afforded one new quassinoid [(-)-odyendanol (1)], one new canthin-6-one alkaloid [9-hydroxy-5-methoxycanthin-6-one (4)], and two new steroids [22E, 24R-stigmasta-5,22-diene-3,7-dione (7) and 22E,24R-stigmast-22-ene-3,7-dione (8)] along with fourteen known compounds. The structures of all compounds were established by analyzing the spectroscopic data. The 13C-NMR values of (-)-odyendene (2) and (-)-odyendane (3), as well as the single-crystal X-ray structure of 5-methoxycanthin-6-one (6) are also reported.The oxidative burst inhibitory activity of pure compounds 1-12 was determined by the chemoluminescence assay, and cytotoxic activities of compounds 2-6 against the human prostate cancer cell PC-3 line were evaluated. Compounds 1-6 exhibited a clear suppressive effect on the phagocytosis response upon activation with serum-opsonized zymosan in the range of IC50=0.9-2.0M versus ibuprofen with IC50=12.1M, while all canthin-6-one alkaloids (4-6) displayed moderate cytotoxic activity against the human prostate cancer cell PC-3 line, with IC50 values ranging from 13.5-15.4M versus doxorubicine with IC50=1.5M.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: A variety of lactose imprinted hydrogels were prepared and their binding properties were studied in comparison with blank non-imprinted hydrogel. Methacrylamide and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate were used as functional monomer and cross-linker, respectively. Dimethylsulfoxide was also applied as polymerisation solvent.

  RESULTS: Different template/monomer ratios were studied and the optimised imprinted hydrogel (MIP2), with a lactose/methacrylamide ratio of 1:8, was selected in a rebinding test. In Scatchard analysis of MIP2-lactose interactions, the dissociation constant and maximum binding sites were 0.33 mmol L-1 and 67.76 mol g-1 hydrogel, respectively. The selectivity of MIP2 for lactose in aqueous media was also evaluated in comparison with different mono- and disaccharides. The data showed that the affinity of MIP2 for lactose is significantly higher than other saccharides. The imprinted hydrogel was finally used as a sorbent for separation of lactose from milk.

  CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that MIP2, as an optimised imprinted hydrogel, can effectively bind lactose and decrease its concentration in milk. Copyright  2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

Abstract
  Electrochemical detection of H(2)O(2) was investigated on a Nafion/exfoliated graphene oxide/Co(3)O(4) nanocomposite (Nafion/EGO/Co(3)O(4)) coated glassy carbon electrode. The morphological characterization was examined by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The modified electrode showed well defined and stable redox couples signal in both alkaline and natural aqueous solutions with excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxidation of hydrogen peroxide. The response of the modified electrode to H(2)O(2) was examined using amperometry (at 0.76 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode) in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). The detection limit was 0.3 umol L(-1) with a linearity of up to four orders of magnitude and a sensitivity of 560 uA mmol(-1)Lcm(-2). The response time of the electrode to achieve 95% of the steady-state current was recorded at 4s. The ability of the sensor for routine analyses was demonstrated by the detection of H(2)O(2) presents in milk samples with appreciable recovery values. In addition, the Nafion/EGO/Co(3)O(4)-GCE showed good selectivity for H(2)O(2) detection in the presence of ascorbic acid, uric acid, and glucose. The attractive analytical performances such as remarkable catalytic activity, good reproducibility, long term stability, and facile preparation method made this novel nanocomposite electrode promising for the development of effective H(2)O(2) sensor.

Abstract
  During the onset of lactation, there is a dramatic increase in the expression of glucose transporters (GLUT) and a group of enzymes involved in milk fat synthesis in the bovine mammary gland. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the lactogenic hormones mediate both of these increases. Bovine mammary explants were cultured for 48, 72, or 96 h with the following hormone treatments: no hormone (control), IGF-I, insulin (Ins), Ins + hydrocortisone + ovine prolactin (InsHPrl), or Ins + hydrocortisone + prolactin + 17-estradiol (InsHPrlE). The relative expression of -casein, -lactalbumin, sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase  (ACACA), stearyol-CoA desaturase (SCD), GLUT1, GLUT8, and GLUT12 were measured by real-time PCR. Exposure to the lactogenic hormone combinations InsHPrl and InsHPrlE for 96 h stimulated expression of -casein and -lactalbumin mRNA by several hundred-fold and also increased the expression of SREBF1, FASN, ACACA, and SCD genes in mammary explants (P < 0.01). However, those hormone combinations had no effect on GLUT1 or GLUT8 expression and inhibited GLUT12 expression by 50% after 72 h of treatment (P < 0.05). In separate experiments, the expression of GLUTs in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 or in bovine primary mammary epithelial cells was not increased by lactogenic hormone treatments. Moreover, treatment of dairy cows with bovine prolactin had no effect on GLUT expression in the mammary gland. In conclusion, lactogenic hormones clearly stimulate expression of milk protein and lipogenic genes, but they do not appear to mediate the marked up-regulation of GLUT expression in the mammary gland during the onset of lactation.

Abstract
  The main objective of this experiment was to monitor the rumination pattern during the transition period in primiparous (PR) and pluriparous (PL) dairy cows and to investigate its relationships with metabolic conditions, milk yield, and health status. The study was carried out in an experimental free-stall barn and involved 32 Italian Friesian cows (9 PR and 23 PL) during the transition phase. The rumination time (RT) was recorded with an automatic system (HR-Tag), and data were calculated and summarized in 2-h intervals. Blood samples were collected during the transition phase to assess biochemical variables related to energy, protein, and mineral metabolism, as well as markers of inflammatory conditions and some enzyme activity. Daily milk yield, BW, nutritional condition, and health status were also recorded. The average RT before calving (-20 to -6 d) was 463 min/d in PR (range 270 to 620) and 522 min/d in PL (range 411 to 640). In the early lactation [15 to 40 d in milk (DIM)], the average RT was 504 min/d in PR (range 400 to 585) and 562 min/d in PL (range 414 to 685) and was positively correlated with milk yield (r = 0.36; P < 0.001). The RT reached the minimum at calving d (262 min/d in PR and 278 min/d in PL). Before calving the percentage of RT during the nighttime was 60% in PR and 62% in PL, whereas the values decreased after calving (55% in PR and 57% in PL). During the first weeks of lactation, PR showed a shorter RT than PL in the 2-h intervals that included milkings. Cows with reduced RT before calving maintained reduced RT after calving and suffered a greater frequency of disease than cows with greater RT in late pregnancy. Moreover, cows characterized by mild inflammatory conditions and without health disorders or only mild health disorders during the puerperium showed a greater average rumination time (over 520 min/d) during the first 10 d of lactation. Conversely, the decreased RT (450 min/d) during the first few days of lactation was observed in cows with subclinical diseases or health disorders. Cows affected by clinical mastitis during the trial showed a reduction of RT and a change in its variability already some days before the drug treatment. Our results suggest that the automatic measurement of RT is useful to predict calving time and to quickly obtain information on health status of the animals in a period as critical as the transition phase.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Current treatment options for castration- and treatment-resistant prostate cancer are limited and novel approaches are desperately needed. Our recent results from a systematic chemical biology sensitivity screen covering most known drugs and drug-like molecules indicated that aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram is one of the most potent cancer-specific inhibitors of prostate cancer cell growth, including TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive cancers. However, the results revealed that disulfiram alone does not block tumor growth in vivo nor induce apoptosis in vitro, indicating that combinatorial approaches may be required to enhance the anti-neoplastic effects.

  METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we utilized a chemical biology drug sensitivity screen to explore disulfiram mechanistic details and to identify compounds potentiating the effect of disulfiram in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive prostate cancer cells. In total, 3357 compounds including current chemotherapeutic agents as well as drug-like small molecular compounds were screened alone and in combination with disulfiram. Interestingly, the results indicated that androgenic and antioxidative compounds antagonized disulfiram effect whereas inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase, proteasome, topoisomerase II, glucosylceramide synthase or cell cycle were among compounds sensitizing prostate cancer cells to disulfiram. The combination of disulfiram and an antiangiogenic agent sunitinib was studied in more detail, since both are already in clinical use in humans. Disulfiram-sunitinib combination induced apoptosis and reduced androgen receptor protein expression more than either of the compounds alone. Moreover, combinatorial exposure reduced metastatic characteristics such as cell migration and 3D cell invasion as well as induced epithelial differentiation shown as elevated E-cadherin expression.

  CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results propose novel combinatorial approaches to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. Disulfiram-sunitinib combination was identified as one of the potent synergistic approaches. Since sunitinib alone has been reported to lack efficacy in prostate cancer clinical trials, our results provide a rationale for novel combinatorial approach to target prostate cancer more efficiently.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hormone-refractory prostate cancer remains hindered by inevitable progression of resistance to first-line treatment with docetaxel. Recent studies suggest that phenotypic changes associated with cancer may be transferred from cell-to-cell via microvesicles/exosomes. Here we aimed to investigate phenotypic changes associated with docetaxel-resistance in order to help determine the complexity of this problem and to assess the relevance of secreted exosomes in prostate cancer.

  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Docetaxel-resistant variants of DU145 and 22Rv1 were established and characterised in terms of cross-resistance, morphology, proliferation, motility, invasion, anoikis, colony formation, exosomes secretion their and functional relevance. Preliminary analysis of exosomes from relevant serum specimens was also performed. Acquired docetaxel-resistance conferred cross-resistance to doxorubicin and induced alterations in motility, invasion, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Exosomes expelled from DU145 and 22Rv1 docetaxel-resistant variants (DU145RD and 22Rv1RD) conferred docetaxel-resistance to DU145, 22Rv1 and LNCap cells, which may be partly due to exosomal MDR-1/P-gp transfer. Exosomes from prostate cancer patients' sera induced increased cell proliferation and invasion, compared to exosomes from age-matched controls. Furthermore, exosomes from sera of patients undergoing a course of docetaxel treatment compared to matched exosomes from the same patients prior to commencing docetaxel treatment, when applied to both DU145 and 22Rv1 cells, showed a correlation between cellular response to docetaxel and patients' response to treatment with docetaxel.

  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our studies indicate the complex and multifaceted nature of docetaxel-resistance in prostate cancer. Furthermore, our in vitro observations and preliminary clinical studies indicate that exosomes may play an important role in prostate cancer, in cell-cell communication, and thus may offer potential as vehicles containing predictive biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer is a highly prevalent disease in older men of the western world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression via posttranscriptional inhibition of protein synthesis. To identify the diagnostic potential of miRNAs in prostate cancer, we downloaded the miRNA expression profile of prostate cancer from the GEO database and analysed the differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) in prostate cancerous tissue compared to non-cancerous tissue. Then, the targets of these DE-miRNAs were extracted from the database and mapped to the STRING and KEGG databases for network construction and pathway enrichment analysis. We identified a total of 16 miRNAs that showed a significant differential expression in cancer samples. A total of 9 target genes corresponding to 3 DE-miRNAs were obtained. After network and pathway enrichment analysis, we finally demonstrated that miR-20 appears to play an important role in the regulation of prostate cancer onset. MiR-20 as single biomarker or in combination could be useful in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. We anticipate our study could provide the groundwork for further experiments.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: We aimed to validate a previously described genetic risk score, denoted the cell-cycle progression (CCP) score, in predicting contemporary radical prostatectomy (RP) outcomes.

  METHODS: RNA was quantified from paraffin-embedded RP specimens. The CCP score was calculated as average expression of 31 CCP genes, normalized to 15 housekeeper genes. Recurrence was defined as two prostate-specific antigen levels >= 0.2 ng/mL or any salvage treatment. Associations between CCP score and recurrence were examined, with adjustment for clinical and pathologic variables using Cox proportional hazards regression and partial likelihood ratio tests. The CCP score was assessed for independent prognostic utility beyond a standard postoperative risk assessment (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical [CAPRA-S] score), and a score combining CAPRA-S and CCP was validated.

  RESULTS: Eighty-two (19.9%) of 413 men experienced recurrence. The hazard ratio (HR) for each unit increase in CCP score (range, -1.62 to 2.16) was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.9); with adjustment for CAPRA-S, the HR was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.4). The score was able to substratify patients with low clinical risk as defined by CAPRA-S <= 2 (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.7). Combining the CCP and CAPRA-S improved the concordance index for both the overall cohort and low-risk subset; the combined CAPRA-S + CCP score consistently predicted outcomes across the range of clinical risk. This combined score outperformed both individual scores on decision curve analysis.

  CONCLUSION: The CCP score was validated to have significant prognostic accuracy after controlling for all available clinical and pathologic data. The score may improve accuracy of risk stratification for men with clinically localized prostate cancer, including those with low-risk disease.

Abstract
  Total of 3 different mixtures of rice bran oil (RBO), sheaolein (SO), and palm stearin (PS) (RBO : SO : PS, 40 : 35 : 25; 15 : 40 : 45; 10 : 35 : 55) were modified by enzymatic interesterification (EIE) using TLIM as a bio-catalyst. After interesterification, a physicochemical properties of selected ratio (10 : 35 : 55; RBO : SO : PS) was compared with chemical interesterification (CIE). CIE sample showed higher SFC than EIE in each measured temperature. DAG content was lower in CIE than EIE sample. Besides, each EIE or CIE products were compared with blends, where higher SFC, longer induction time was observed in the blends. Oxidative stability was measured based on Rancimat and peroxide value (PV) where EIE sample showed longer induction time and lower PV compared to CIE sample. Further, EIE sample was selected for oxidation studies and kept at 60 C for 22 d after the addition of antioxidants (EGCG, rosemary) where induction time was significantly increased compared to control. EGCG containing sample showed longer induction time and lower PV compared to rosemary containing sample.  2012 Institute of Food Technologists

Abstract
  AIM: Fatigue can be defined as an unpleasant feeling of tiredness, weakness and lack of energy. It is found in about 80% of the patients receiving radiation therapy and has a significant impact on quality of life. The aim of this paper was to assess the frequency, severity and changes of fatigue before, during and after administration of a nutraceutical (mixture of whey protein with an high biological value, with an high content in native cysteine, albumin and lactoferrin in patients undergoing treatment for breast and prostate cancer.

  METHODS: Thirty patients (20 breast and 10 prostate ones) were enrolled in our test and they received a questionnaire about Fatigue developed by the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1999. The patients who achieved a score between 4 and 6 were administered the nutraceutical (Prother) at a dose of 20 mg / day for the first 10 days of radiation treatment and then 10 mg/day for the following 20 days without considering the terms of the radiation oncology treatment. Each patient was reassessed using the same Fatigue test after 10 and 30 days from the start of the administration of nutraceutical. We enrolled 30 control patients who did not receive Prother.

  RESULTS: The results showed the effectiveness of Prother in all patients with moderate-to-mild fatigue.

  CONCLUSION: The administration of Prother has therefore been effective in terms of both improving the compliance of the radiation treatment and the quality of life.

Abstract
  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell growth and its uncontrolled activation is a hallmark of cancer. Moreover, mTOR activation has been implicated in the resistance of cancer cells to many anticancer drugs, rendering this pathway a promising pharmacotherapeutic target. Here we explored the capability of a semisynthetic compound to intercept mTOR signaling. We synthesized and chemically characterized a novel, semisynthetic triterpenoid derivative, 3-cinnamoyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (C-KBA). Its pharmacodynamic effects on mTOR and several other signaling pathways were assessed in a number of prostate and breast cancer cell lines as well as in normal prostate epithelial cells. C-KBA exhibits specific antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in cancer cell lines in vitro as well as in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts in vivo. Mechanistically, the compound significantly inhibits the cap-dependent transition machinery, decreases expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E and cyclin D1, and induces G(1) cell-cycle arrest. In contrast to conventional mTOR inhibitors, C-KBA downregulates the phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, the major downstream target of mTOR complex 1, without concomitant activation of mTOR complex 2/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, and independently of protein phosphatase 2A, liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase/tuberous sclerosis complex, and F12-protein binding. At the molecular level, the compound binds to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain of mTOR with high affinity, thereby competing with the endogenous mTOR activator phosphatidic acid. C-KBA represents a new type of proapoptotic mTOR inhibitor that, due to its special mechanistic profile, might overcome the therapeutic drawbacks of conventional mTOR inhibitors.

Abstract
  The oxidative and physical stabilities of oil-in-water emulsions containing n-3 fatty acids (25 wt.% oil, 2.5 wt.% whey protein, pH 3.0 or pH 6.0), and their subsequent incorporation into meat products were investigated. The physical stability of fish oil emulsions was excellent and neither coalescence nor aggregation occurred during storage. Oxidative stability was better at pH 6.0 compared to pH 3.0 likely due to antioxidative continuous phase proteins. Incorporation of fish oil emulsions into pork sausages led to an increase in oxidation compared to sausages without the added fish oil emulsion. Confocal microscopy of pork sausages with fish oil emulsions revealed that droplets had coalesced in the meat matrix over time which may have contributed to the decreased oxidative stability. Results demonstrate that although interfacial engineering of n-3 fatty acids containing oil-in-water emulsions provides physical and oxidative stability of the base-emulsion, their incorporation into complex meat matrices is a non-trivial undertaking and products may incur changes in quality over time.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of prostate cancer and identification of new prognostic factors remain main issues in prostate cancer research. In this study, we sought to test a panel of cancer-specific markers in urine samples as an aid for early cancer diagnosis.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sedimented urine samples of 66 candidates for needle biopsy were tested. Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to detect the expression of transmembrane protease serine-2 and Ets-related gene fusion (TMPRSS2-ERG), Ets-related gene (ERG), prostate cancer antigen-3 (PCA3), and serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type-1 (SPINK1) transcripts. For testing of the methylation status of Glutahione S-tranferase P (GSTP1) and Ras association domain family member-1(RASSF1A) promoter region, methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR) was applied.

  RESULTS: Among the tested parameters, the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG (OR=9.044, 95% CI=2.207-37.066, p=0.002), as well as a positive test result for PCA3 (OR=7.549, 95% CI=1,858-30,672, p=0.005) were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer. A multivariable logistic regression including all the significantly associated variables [prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE), TMPRSS2-ERG and PCA3], yielded a model with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) =0.894 (95% CI=0.772-1.00).

  CONCLUSION: A multiplexed quantitative PCR analysis on sedimented urine, in conjunction with the results of serum PSA levels and DRE, has the potential to accurately foresee subsequent needle biopsy outcomes. On the basis of the above, algorithms may be designed to guide decisions for needle biopsy.

Abstract
  Transferrin (Tf) conjugates of monomeric artemisinin (ART) and artemisinin dimer were synthesized. The two conjugates, ART-Tf and dimer-Tf, retained the original protein structure, and formed stable aggregates in aqueous buffer. ART-Tf induced declines in proteins involved in apoptosis (survivin), cell cycling (cyclin D1), oncogenesis (c-myelocytomatosis oncogene product (c-MYC)), and dysregulated WNT signaling (beta-catenin) in both the human prostate (DU145) and breast (MCF7) cancer cell lines. Both ART-Tf and dimer-Tf induced down-regulation of survivin, c-MYC and mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ERBB2 or HER2) in the BT474 breast cancer cell line. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an ART derivative can cause a decline of ERBB2 in a human cancer cell line. Potential mechanisms for the observed effects are presented. Both transferrin conjugates strongly inhibited the growth of BT474 cells in the same concentration range that the conjugates caused declines in the levels of ERBB2, survivin, and c-MYC, while showing essentially no toxicity towards MCF10A normal breast cells.

Abstract
  Widespread interest in the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the androgen receptor (AR) has been stimulated by the finding that AR signaling is critically important in the progression of human prostate cancers. Co-factors, the co-repressors, or the co-activators are responsible for the regulation of AR activation. The pro-oncogene human Long Interspersed Nucleotide acid Element-1 (LINE-1) encodes LINE-1 ORF-1p and plays important roles in the development and progression of several human carcinomas. In this study, the results showed that LINE-1 ORF-1p increased the AR transcriptional activity and in turn enhanced the expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the presence of R1881. A physical protein-protein interaction between the AR signaling and the LINE-1 ORF-1p was identified by the immunoprecipitation assays and GST pull-down assays. Furthermore, LINE-1 ORF-1p would function as a novel AR positive co-regulator through modulating its cytoplasm/nucleus translocation and the recruitment to the androgen response element in the PSA gene promoter. Our date also showed that the LINE-1 ORF-1p promoted the proliferation and anchor-independent growth of LNCaP (ligand dependent) and PC-3 (ligand independent) human prostatic carcinoma cells. By investigating a novel role of the LINE-1 ORF-1p in the androgen/androgen receptor signaling pathway regulation, our study identifies that LINE-1 ORF-1p may be a novel AR co-regulator and molecular target for human prostate carcinoma therapy.

Abstract
  This study was performed to examine the microorganisms responsible for the high tyramine content of Cheonggukjang, a traditional Korean fermented soy food, and to establish a technology for controlling the growth of these microorganisms. The tyramine content in 13 collected Cheonggukjang samples averaged 604.9 mg/kg. Since the tyramine content measured from most samples was sufficient to cause harm to the human body, it is necessary to control its production in food. Enterococci were confirmed to be the bacterial species producing most of the tyramine through the microbial examination and were present in high numbers from not detected (<10(1)) to 7.0 x 10(10) colony-forming units (CFU)/g. To control the growth of enterococci, various plant extracts with antimicrobial activity, common salts, and variable temperature conditions were tested. It was found that 4 samples among the 159 plant extracts had a strong antimicrobial activity in Cheonggukjang, especially against Enterococcus faecium, showing viable cell counts of <10(1)-10(3) CFU/g after 24 h of ripening, which were significantly lower values compared to the control (10(9)-10(11) CFU/g). The Cheonggukjang with the addition of the four plant extracts showed ~83%-95% lower concentrations of tyramine compared to the control. Cheonggukjang prepared with the Schizandra chinensis Baillon extract had the lowest tyramine content without sacrificing the sensory quality. Not only was the bacterial species of E. faecium reduced more remarkably, by up to 10(3) CFU/g compared to the 10(9)-10(11) CFU/g shown in the control, but it also decreased the tyramine content by up to 91%.

Abstract
  C-phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina has been previously shown to have anticancer properties. Here, we report on anticancer activity of C-PC that was isolated from the novel cyanobacterium Limnothrix sp. 37-2-1. C-PC from this organism exhibited anticancer properties in our in vitro systems; however, the required doses were well above the range of anticancer drugs normally used. Therefore, we conducted several experiments to test whether lower-than-usual doses of the anticancer drug topotecan (TPT) can offer the same level of cytotoxic effects as normal doses when combined with C-PC. For this purpose, cytotoxicities of C-PC and TPT were tested using the LNCaP (prostate cancer) cells. We found that when only 10% of a typical dose of TPT was combined with C-PC, the cancer cells were killed at a higher rate than when TPT was used alone at full dose. Similarly, we were also able to detect an increased level of radical oxygen species (ROS) generation as well as an increase in activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3 when these two compounds were used in combination. Taken together, our findings suggest that combining C-PC from Limnothrix sp. with the lower dose of TPT can induce apoptosis through generation of ROS and activation of caspases. In that respect, we suggest that C-PC can potentially improve the efficacy of the currently available anticancer drug, and therefore diminish its harsh side effects in the patient.

Abstract
  SCOPE: Cow's milk allergy is the most prevalent food allergy in infants whose immune system development is critically stimulated during postnatal gut colonization by commensal bacteria. Allergenic potential of cow's milk -lactoglobulin (BLG) and caseins (CAS) was investigated in germ-free (GF) BALB/c mice and in GF mice conventionalized (CVd) at 6 weeks of age.

  METHODS AND RESULTS: Oral sensitization to cow's milk in the presence of cholera toxin led to higher BLG-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a responses in GF mice than in conventional (CV) mice. No significant difference was observed for CAS-specific IgE responses although IgG1 responses to S1- and k-caseins were higher in GF mice than in CV mice. CVd mice, orally inoculated with fecal preparations from CV mice, also displayed biased antibody responses compared to CV mice. Secretion of Th2 cytokines by BLG- and CAS-reactivated splenocytes of CVd mice was similar to that of GF mice whereas cytokine production by reactivated cells from mesenteric lymph nodes of CVd mice was equivalent to that of CV mice.

  CONCLUSION: Oral sensitization to BLG and CAS was differentially affected by the absence of gut microbiota and delayed bacterial colonization altered persistently the host immune response to oral sensitization against food antigens.  2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

Abstract
  SCOPE: The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of high-intensity ultrasound (sonication), on the structure and allergenicity of the major cow's milk allergen, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG).

  METHODS AND RESULTS: Structural changes upon sonication of BLG were monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy, tryptophan emission fluorescence, hydrophobic dye and retinol binding, as well as digestibility and phenol-oxidase cross-linking capacity. Allergenicity was monitored in individual patients' sera, basophil activation test, and skin prick testing in 41 cow's milk allergy patients. Uncontrolled local temperature changes induced modifications in BLG secondary structure accompanied by formation of dimers, trimers, and oligomers of BLG that were more digestible by pepsin and had reduced retinol binding. Controlled temperature conditions induced changes in secondary structure of BLG without causing formation of oligomers, or changing protein's capacity to bind retinol. Both sonicated forms of BLG had more exposed hydrophobic surfaces than native BLG and underwent facilitated cross-linking reaction with phenol-oxidase. Sonication had a minor effect on IgE-binding properties of BLG.

  CONCLUSION: Sonication-induced structural changes in major whey allergen were not clinically significant in cow's milk allergy patients. Ultrasound can be a safe procedure for dairy processing as it maintains the nutritional value and does not increase allergenic potential of BLG.  2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

Abstract
  FLI1 and ERG, the major ETS transcription factors involved in rearrangements in the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) and in prostate carcinomas (PCa), respectively, belong to the same subfamily, having 98% sequence identity in the DNA binding domain. We therefore decided to investigate whether the aberrant transcription factors in both malignancies have some common downstream targets. We crossed a publicly available list of all putative EWSR1-FLI1 target genes in ESFT with our microarray expression data on 24 PCa and 6 non-malignant prostate tissues (NPT) and choose four genes among the top-most differentially expressed between PCa with (PCa ERG+) and without (PCa ETS-) ETS fusion genes (HIST1H4L, KCNN2, ECRG4 and LDOC1), as well as four well-validated direct targets of the EWSR1-FLI1 chimeric protein in ESFT (NR0B1, CAV1, IGFBP3 and TGFBR2). Using quantitative expression analysis in 16 ESFT and seven alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS), we were able to validate the four genes previously described as direct targets of the EWSR1-FLI1 oncoprotein, showing overexpression of CAV1 and NR0B1 and underexpression of IGFBP3 and TGFBR2 in ESFT as compared to ARMS. Although none of these four genes showed significant expression differences between PCa ERG+ and PCa ETS-, CAV1, IGFBP3 and TGFBR2 were less expressed in PCa in an independent series of 56 PCa and 15 NPT, as also observed for ECRG4 and LDOC1, suggesting a role in prostate carcinogenesis in general. On the other hand, we demonstrate for the first time that both HIST1H4L and KCNN2 are significantly overexpressed in PCa ERG+ and that ERG binds to the promoter of these genes. Conversely, KCNN2 was found underexpressed in ESFT relative to ARMS, suggesting that the EWSR1-ETS oncoprotein may have the opposite effect of ERG rearrangements in PCa. We conclude that aberrant ETS transcription factors modulate target genes differently in ESFT and PCa.

Abstract
  Probiotics with ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is considered as an additive health benefit property for its known role in colon cancer mitigation. The conversion involves the biohydrogenation of the unsaturated fatty acid into conjugated form. Probiotic strain Pediococcus spp. GS4 was efficiently able to biohydrogenate linoleic acid (LA) into its conjugated form within 48h of incubation. Quantum of CLA produced with a concentration of 121ug/ml and sustained cell viability of 8.94log cfu/ml maximally. Moreover, antibacterial effect of LA on the strain ability for biohydrogenation was examined at different concentrations and concluded to have a direct relationship between LA and amount of CLA produced. The efficiency of the strain for CLA production at different pH was also estimated and found maximum at pH6.0 with 149ug/ml while this ability was reduced at pH9.0 to 63ug/ml. Sesame oil, which is rich in the triacylglycerol form of LA, was also found to act as a substrate for CLA production by Pediococcus spp. GS4 with the aid of lipase-catalyzed triacylglycerol hydrolysis and amount of CLA produced was 31ug/ml at 0.2% while 150ug/ml at 1.0% of lipolysed oil in skim milk medium. Conjugated form was analyzed using UV scanning, RP-HPLC, and GC-MS. This study also focused on the alternative use of lipolysed sesame oil instead of costly LA for biohydrogenation and could be a potential source for the industrial production of CLA.

Abstract
  Miyamoto and colleagues present data that prostate-specific antigen/prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSA/PSMA)-based measurements of androgen receptor (AR) signaling in circulating tumor cells (CTC) enable real-time quantitative monitoring of intratumoral AR signaling. This finding indicates that measuring AR signaling within CTCs may help to guide therapy in metastatic prostate cancer and highlights the use of CTCs as liquid biopsy. 2012 AACR.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is initially effective in treating metastatic prostate cancer, and secondary hormonal therapies are being tested to suppress androgen receptor (AR) reactivation in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite variable responses to AR pathway inhibitors in CRPC, there are no reliable biomarkers to guide their application. Here, we used microfluidic capture of circulating tumor cells (CTC) to measure AR signaling readouts before and after therapeutic interventions. Single-cell immunofluorescence analysis revealed predominantly "AR-on" CTC signatures in untreated patients, compared with heterogeneous ("AR-on, AR-off, and AR-mixed") CTC populations in patients with CRPC. Initiation of first-line ADT induced a profound switch from "AR-on" to "AR-off" CTCs, whereas secondary hormonal therapy in CRPC resulted in variable responses. Presence of "AR-mixed" CTCs and increasing "AR-on" cells despite treatment with abiraterone acetate were associated with an adverse treatment outcome. Measuring treatment-induced signaling responses within CTCs may help guide therapy in prostate cancer.

  SIGNIFICANCE: Acquired resistance to first-line hormonal therapy in prostate cancer is heterogeneous in the extent of AR pathway reactivation. Measurement of pre- and posttreatment AR signaling within CTCs may help target such treatments to patients most likely to respond to second-line therapies. 2012 AACR.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men worldwide. Alterations in the DNA methylation pattern can be one of the leading causes for prostate cancer formation. This study is the first high-throughput sequencing study investigating genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in a large cohort of 51 tumor and 53 benign prostate samples using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparative analyses identified more than 147,000 cancer-associated epigenetic alterations. In addition, global methylation patterns show significant differences based on the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement status. We propose the hypermethylation of miR-26a as an alternative pathway of ERG rearrangement-independent EZH2 activation. The observed increase in differential methylation events in fusion-negative tumors can explain the tumorigenic process in the absence of genomic rearrangements.

  SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to TMPRSS2-ERG -rearranged tumors, the pathomechanism for gene fusion-negative tumors is completely unclear. Using a sequencing-based approach, our work uncovers significant global epigenetic alterations in TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion-negative tumors and provides a mechanistic explanation for the tumor formation process. 2012 AACR.

Abstract
  The objective of the present study was to analyse the apoptotic process of liver cells in dairy cows with fatty infiltration of the liver using indicators of DNA damage and immunohistochemistry. For this purpose, sixteen dairy cows with fatty liver were examined. On clinical examination, the physical condition of the animals was fair in nine and poor in seven cows. The most dominant clinical signs were reduced ruminal motility, inappetance and/or anorexia and recumbency. Postmortem examination, in seven cases, revealed enlarged liver (18-33 kg), icteric carcasses and distended gallbladder. Laboratory results included neutrophilia, hypochloraemia, decreased concentrations of total bilirubin and increased concentrations of -hydroxy butyric acid, non-esterified fatty acids and insulin. The activities of aspartate aminotransferase, -glutamyl transpeptidase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were high. Histopathological examination of hepatic specimen showed lipid drops in cytosol with indistinct cellular membranes. In control hepatic cells, the DNA was tightly compressed and maintained the circular disposition of the normal nucleus. However, in the diseased cows, the damaged DNA migrated from the core toward the anode, forming a tail of a comet. Compared to controls, numerous ssDNA and caspase-3-positive cells were detected in the liver. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to document accelerated apoptosis of hepatocytes in dairy cows with fatty infiltration of the liver. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer cells include a small population of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/cancer-initiating cells (CICs) that have roles in initiation and progression of the cancer. Recently, we isolated prostate CSCs/CICs as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1-highh (ALDH1(high) ) cells using the ALDEFLUOR assay; however, the molecular mechanisms of prostate CSCs/CICs are still elusive. Prostate CSCs/CICs were isolated as ALDH1(high) cells using the ALDEFLUOR assay, and the gene expression profiles were analyzed using a cDNA microarray and RT-PCR. We found that prostate CSCs/CICs expressed higher levels of growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Hepatocyte growth factor protein expression was confirmed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. On the other hand, c-MET HGF receptor was expressed in both CSCs/CICs and non-CSCs/CICs at similar levels. Hepatocyte growth factor and the supernatant of myofibloblasts derived from the prostate augmented prostasphere formation in vitro, and prostasphere formation was inhibited by an anti-HGF antibody. Furthermore, c-MET gene knockdown by siRNA inhibited the prostasphere-forming ability in vitro and tumor-initiating ability in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that HGF secreted by prostate CSCs/CICs and prostate myofibroblasts has a role in the maintenance of prostate CSCs/CICs in an autocrine and paracrine fashion.  2013 Japanese Cancer Association.

Abstract
  Although protein kinase D3 (PKD3) has been shown to contribute to prostate cancer cell growth and survival, the role of PKD in prostate cancer cell motility remains unclear. Here, we show that PKD2 and PKD3 promote nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression/activation, which are crucial for prostate cancer cell invasion. Silencing of endogenous PKD2 and/or PKD3 markedly decreased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, reduced uPA and uPA receptor (uPAR) expression and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) expression. These results were further substantiated by the finding that PKD2 and PKD3 promoted the activity of uPA and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Furthermore, depletion of PKD2 and/or PKD3 decreased the level of binding of the p65 subunit of NF-kB to the promoter of the gene encoding uPA (PLAU), suppressing transcriptional activation of uPA. Endogenous PKD2 and PKD3 interacted with inhibitor of NF-kB (IkB) kinase  (IKK); PKD2 mainly regulated the phosphorylated IKK (pIKK)-phosphorylated IkB (pIkB)-IkB degradation cascade, p65 nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation of Ser276 on p65, whereas PKD3 was responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser536 on p65. Conversely, inhibition of uPA transactivation by PKD3 silencing was rescued by constitutive Ser536 p65 phosphorylation, and reduced tumor cell invasion resulting from PKD2 or PKD3 silencing was rescued by ectopic expression of p65. Interestingly, PKD3 interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), suppressing HDAC1 expression and decreasing its binding to the uPA promoter. Moreover, depletion of HDAC1 resulted in recovery of uPA transactivation in PKD3-knockdown cells. Taken together, these data suggest that PKD2 and PKD3 coordinate to promote prostate cancer cell invasion through p65 NF-kB- and HDAC1-mediated expression and activation of uPA.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of maternal smoking on antioxidative capacity and intensity of oxidative damage in breast milk.

  STUDY DESIGN: The study group (n=30) was comprised of postpartum women who declared smoking more than five cigarettes per day during pregnancy and lactation (confirmed by the urinalysis of cotinine concentration), and their newborns. Control group included 29 non-smoking postpartum women and their newborns. Colostrum samples were collected on the 3rd day after delivery and breast milk samples between the 30th and the 32nd day after delivery. Morning maternal and neonatal urine samples were obtained on the day of the mature milk sampling. Isoprostane concentrations in colostrum/mature milk and urine were determined immunoenzymatically. Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) of colostrum/breast milk was determined by Rice-Evans and Miller method.

  RESULT: Colostrum TAS in smokers was significantly lower than in non-smokers (P=0.006). In both groups, the TAS of mature milk was higher compared with colostrum, but significant differences were observed amongst smokers only (P=0.001). In smokers the isoprostane concentration of mature milk was significantly higher than the colostrum concentration (P=0.001). Significant inverse correlation between maternal urinary isoprostane concentration and the TAS of mature breast milk was observed in smokers (R=-0.525, P=0.023), but not in non-smokers (R=0.161, P=0.422).

  CONCLUSION: This study revealed that maternal smoking triggers harmful effects on an infant by impairing pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance of breast milk.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is an incurable disease and both androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) are closely related to CRPC transition. More knowledge concerning neuroendocrine (NE)-transformed PC cells, the NED process and its association with CRPC, is needed. Expression of growth factor midkine (MDK) is correlated with poor clinical outcomes in various human cancers, including PC. In the present study, we have evaluated MDK expression and NED in two separate tumor groups: early and advanced PC.

  METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of MDK, the neuronal marker tubulin-beta III (TUBB3) and the NE-marker chromogranin A (CGA) in a human archival material consisting of hormone naive (HN)/stage T1b (n=29) and CRPC (n=24) tumors. Triple immunofluorescent imaging was performed on a selection of specimens.

  RESULTS: MDK, TUBB3, and CGA were upregulated in CRPC compared to HN tumors. MDK was highly associated to the expression of both CGA and TUBB3, and identified MDK-positive NE-like looking cells found to co-express CGA or, more commonly, CGA together with TUBB3. CGA and TUBB3 staining displayed a partial expression overlap, an overlap almost exclusively displaying also MDK expression.

  CONCLUSIONS: MDK upregulation in CRPC is associated with NED (shown by its relation to CGA and TUBB3). The results suggest that MDK represents an over-bridging marker between different populations of NE-like tumor cells, possibly as part of the NED process and associated CRPC transition, something that needs to be evaluated experimentally as does the applicability of MDK as a future target.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin malignancy in men in the Western world, yet few disease-associated mutations have been found. Recently, a low frequency recurring mutation in the HOXB13 gene was reported among both hereditary PC families and men from the general population.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the distribution and frequency of the G84E HOXB13 variant in 1,310 incipient PC cases and 1,259 age-mated controls from a population-based, case-control study of PC.

  RESULTS: The G84E mutation was more frequent in cases than controls (1.3% vs. 0.4%, respectively), and men with the HOXB13 G84E variant had a 3.3-fold higher relative risk of PC compared with noncarriers (95% CI, 1.21-8.96). There was a stronger association between the G84E variant and PC among men with no first-degree relative with PC (OR, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.12-14.51) compared to men with a family history of PC (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.30-7.50; P=0.36 for interaction). We observed some evidence of higher risk estimates associated with the variant for men with higher versus lower Gleason score (OR, 4.13; 95% CI, 1.38-12.38 vs. OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 0.88-8.30), and advanced versus local stage (OR, 4.47; 95% CI, 1.28-15.57 vs. OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.04-8.49), however these differences were not statistically different.

  CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the association of a rare HOXB13 mutation with PC in the general population and suggest that this variant may be associated with features of more aggressive disease. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In prostate cancer cells, transforming growth factor  (TGF) inhibits proliferation in earlier stages of the disease; however, the cancer cells become refractory to growth inhibitory effects in advanced stages where TGF promotes cancer progression and metastasis. Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) family of closely related proteins (Id1-Id4) are dominant negative regulators and basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors and in general promote proliferation, and inhibit differentiation. In the present study, we have investigated the role of Id1 and Id3 proteins in the growth inhibitory effects of TGF on prostate cancer cells.

  METHODS: The effect of TGF  on proliferation and Id1 and Id3 expression were investigated in PZ-HPV7, DU145, and PC3 cells. Id1 silencing through siRNA was also used in DU145 and PC3 cells to examine its role in anti-proliferative and migratory effects of TGF.

  RESULTS: TGF increased expression of Id1 and Id3 in all cell lines followed by a later down regulation of Id1 in PZ-HPV7 expression and DU145 cells but not in PC3 cells. Id3 expression remained elevated in all three cell lines. This loss of Id1 protein correlated with an increase of CDKNI p21. Id1 knockdown in both DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in decreased proliferation. However, while TGF caused a further decrease in proliferation of DU145, but had no further effects in PC3 cells. Knockdown of Id1 or Id3 inhibited TGF1induced migration in PC3 cells.

  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an essential role of Id1 and Id3 in TGF1 effects on proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a complex multi-allelic disease and the most common malignancy in men. The incidence of prostate cancer in African American men is more than twice as high as that of any other race. Despite the high prevalence of prostate cancer amongst African American men, this population has been under represented in genetic studies of prostate cancer. Although genomic copy number variations (CNVs) have been detected in prostate tumors, this is the first study describing germline CNVs in African American hereditary prostate cancer families.

  METHODS: Ten high-risk African American families with three or more affected individuals and with an early age of onset were recruited. From these families, 37 individuals, including 23 affected males, and 14 unaffected males, were selected for CNV analysis. Array comparative genomic hybridization was used to characterize germline CNVs unique to African American men with hereditary prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: Through common aberration analysis in affected family members; novel CNVs were identified at chromosomes 1p36.13 and 16q23.3. Differential analysis comparing affected and unaffected family members identified 9.4kb duplication on chromosome 14q32.33 which segregate with prostate cancer patients in these high-risk families.

  CONCLUSIONS: The duplication at 14q32.33 encompasses IGHG3 gene which has been shown to have both significant gains in copy number as well as overexpression in prostate tumors in African Americans. These CNVs may represent a component of genetic predisposition which contributes to the high prevalence and mortality of prostate cancer in African American men.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: STEAP1 is over-expressed in several types of tumors, especially prostate cancer, where it is localized in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells, at cell-cell junctions. Its role in prostate carcinogenesis and its regulation in prostate cells remain unknown. Therefore, we propose to study the effect of sex hormones in the regulation of STEAP1 expression in prostate cells in vitro and in vivo.

  METHODS: LNCaP prostate cells were incubated with fetal bovine serum (FBS), charcoal-stripped FBS (CS-FBS), 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 17-estradiol (E2 ) for different periods of stimulation. In addition, adult male Wistar rats were castrated and treated with DHT and E2 . The levels of STEAP1 in response to treatments were analyzed by real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry.

  RESULTS: The treatment of LNCaP cells with DHT or E2 induces a down-regulation of STEAP1 expression, while incubation with CS-FBS has the opposite effect. Experiments using inhibitors of androgen and estrogen receptor (AR and ER) showed that down-regulation of STEAP1 is AR-dependent, but ER-independent. However, the mediation of six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) expression by AR seems to be dependent of de novo protein synthesis. In vivo studies showed that castrated rats express higher levels of STEAP1 protein when compared to intact rats, an effect reversed by DHT or E2 replacement.

  CONCLUSIONS: STEAP1 is down-regulated by DHT and E2 in LNCaP cells and in rat prostate. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs play a pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. The present study was aimed at clarifying the biological functions of miR-153, one of the upregulated microRNAs in prostate cancers, and the signaling transduction induced by miR-153.

  METHODS: miR-153 was identified to be overexpressed in prostate cancers. The probable biological function of miR-153 in cellular proliferation was then examined by diverse assays, such as MTT, colony formation and BrdUrd incorporation assay. Moreover, real-time PCR and western blotting analysis were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism induced by miR-153. Luciferase assays were used to determined the FOXO1 transactivity and the direct regulation of PTEN-3'-UTR by miR-153.

  RESULTS: High-throughput method identified miR-153 to be upregulated in prostate cancers, which is further confirmed by the upregulated expression in four paired prostate tumor/adjacent non-cancerous tissues from the same patients. Further studies revealed that overexpression of miR-153 promoted cell cycle transition and cell proliferation, while inhibition of miR-153 reduced this effect. Moreover, miR-153 overexpression in prostate cancer cells increased the G1/S transitional promoter, cyclin D1 expression, and decreased cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21(Cip1) expression. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-153 directly targeted the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, activated the AKT signaling and downregulated FOXO1 transcriptional activity.

  CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that miR-153 play an important role in promoting proliferation of human prostate cancer cells and present a novel mechanism of microRNA-mediated direct suppression of PTEN expression in prostate cancer cells. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptor beta (ER) has been demonstrated to be expressed in prostate carcinoma cells and estrogen signals through ER to act as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer patients. ER is thought to regulate the cell cycle of prostate carcinoma cells by controlling the expression of cell cycle regulators including cyclin D1 (CCND1). This interaction is of particular interest as CCND1 has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer.

  METHODS: We evaluated ER and CCND1 immunoreactivity in human prostate cancer (n=112, surgical specimens), and correlated the findings with clinicopathological features of the patients. Subsequent in vitro experiments using PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells were also performed to examine whether estradiol (E2) could change the expression level of CCND1 mRNA.

  RESULTS: CCND1 immunoreactivity was detected in 78/112 cases (70%), and was significantly correlated with incidence of perineural invasion and ER immunoreactivity (P<0.05). Forty-eight hours incubation with E2 (10nM) increased the expression level of CCND1 mRNA as well as c-jun (JUN) and c-fos (FOS) in PC-3 cells, and PHTPP (ER antagonist) suppressed E2 -induced expression of those mRNAs.

  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CCND1 expression is possibly regulated by estrogens via ER and that this signaling pathway may influence prostate cancer development. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The recent recommendation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer was based, in part, on the lack of demonstrated diagnostic utility of serum PSA values in the low, but detectable range to successfully predict prostate cancer. Though controversial, this recommendation reinforced the critical need to develop, validate, and determine the utility of other serum and/or urine transcript and protein markers as diagnostic markers for PCa. The studies described here were intended to determine whether inflammatory cytokines might augment serum PSA as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer.

  METHODS: Multiplex ELISA assays were performed to quantify CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, CCL8, CCL11, CCL17, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL12, and IL-6 protein levels in the serum of 272 men demonstrating serum PSA values of <10ng/ml and undergoing a 12 core diagnostic needle biopsy for detection of prostate cancer. Logistic regression was used to identify the associations between specific chemokines and prostate cancer status adjusted for prostate volume, and baseline PSA.

  RESULTS: Serum levels for CCL1 (I-309) were significantly elevated among all men with enlarged prostates (P<0.04). Serum levels for CCL11 (Eotaxin-1) were significantly elevated among men with prostate cancer regardless of prostate size (P<0.01). The remaining 10 cytokines examined in this study did not exhibit significant correlations with either prostate volume or cancer status.

  CONCLUSIONS: Serum CCL11 values may provide a useful diagnostic tool to help distinguish between prostatic enlargement and prostate cancer among men demonstrating low, but detectable, serum PSA values. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer disseminates to regional lymph nodes, however the molecular mechanisms responsible for lymph node metastasis are poorly understood. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligand and receptor family have been implicated in the growth and spread of prostate cancer via activation of the blood vasculature and lymphatic systems. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine the expression pattern of VEGF ligands and receptors in the glandular epithelium, stroma, lymphatic vasculature and blood vessels in prostate cancer.

  METHODS: The localization of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 was examined in cancerous and adjacent benign prostate tissue from 52 subjects representing various grades of prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: Except for VEGFR-2, extensive staining was observed for all ligands and receptors in the prostate specimens. In epithelial cells, VEGF-A and VEGFR-1 expression was higher in tumor tissue compared to benign tissue. VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 expression was significantly higher in benign tissue compared to tumor in the stroma and the endothelium of lymphatic and blood vessels. In addition, the frequency of lymphatic vessels, but not blood vessels, was lower in tumor tissue compared with benign tissue.

  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that activation of VEGFR-1 by VEGF-A within the carcinoma, and activation of lymphatic endothelial cell VEGFR-3 by VEGF-D within the adjacent benign stroma may be important signaling mechanisms involved in the progression and subsequent metastatic spread of prostate cancer. Thus inhibition of these pathways may contribute to therapeutic strategies for the management of prostate cancer. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  Cell-mediated immunity may impact prostate cancer progression and has great therapeutic potential. Here, we investigated the clinical significance of the numeric density of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in prostate cancer as the presence of such cells in the tumour microenvironment has been linked to clinical outcome in other tumour entities. We detected Tregs by FOXP3 immunohistochemistry in 88.8% of 2002 prostate cancer specimens in tissue microarray format, the largest cohort so far in which Tregs have been quantified. The density of Tregs in tumour tissue was compared with pathological parameters and clinical outcome. The number of Tregs identified per 0.6mm tissue spot ranged from 1 to 10 in normal and 1 to 103 FOXP3+ cells in tumour samples. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival was significantly reduced in patients with higher numbers of Tregs (p=0.0151). Further, a higher number of intratumoural FOXP3+ Tregs was associated with a more advanced tumour stage (p=0.0355) and higher Ki67 labelling index (p<0.0001). The tissue density of Tregs was unrelated to other clinical parameters such as spread to lymph nodes, preoperative PSA level and Gleason score. Our study suggests that the intratumoural presence of regulatory T cells may have substantial functional impact and may confer an adverse clinical course in prostate cancer.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Active monitoring of prostate cancer requires the selection of low-risk cancers and subsequent identification of disease progression. Our objective was to determine whether serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-2 or IGFBP-3 at diagnosis (potential biomarkers of prognosis), and repeated measures of IGFBP-2 (potential biomarker of tumour growth), were associated with annual change in PSA and PSA doubling time (PSADT), proxies for disease progression.

  METHODS: We investigated associations of circulating IGFs and IGFBPs with PSA measures using multilevel models, in 909 men (recruited between 1999 and 2009) with PSA-detected clinically localized prostate cancer undergoing active monitoring in the United Kingdom. Each man had an average of 14 measurements of PSA during a mean of 4-year follow-up.

  RESULTS: IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were not associated with baseline PSA. There was weak evidence that IGF-I at diagnosis was positively associated with a rapid post-diagnosis PSADT (<=4years vs. >4years): OR 1.34 (95% CI 0.98, 1.81) per SD increase in IGF-I. IGFBP-2 increased by 2.1% (95% CI 1.4, 2.8) per year between 50 and 70years, with no association between serial IGFBP-2 levels and PSADT. There was no evidence that serum IGF-II, IGFBP-2, or IGFBP-3, or post-diagnosis IGFBP-2, were associated with PSA kinetics in men with PSA-detected localized prostate cancer.

  CONCLUSIONS: The weak association of IGF-I with PSADT requires replication in larger datasets, and more definitive evidence will be provided on the maturity of long-term active monitoring cohorts with relevant clinical outcomes (metastasis and prostate cancer mortality).

Abstract
  We aimed to compare the effect of 12-week feeding of commercially available infant formulas with different percentages of palmitic acid at sn-2 (beta-palmitate) on anthropometric measures and bone strength of term infants. It was hypothesized that feeding infants with high beta-palmitate (HBP) formula will enhance their bone speed of sound (SOS). Eighty-three infants appropriate for gestational age participated in the study; of these, 58 were formula-fed and 25 breast-fed infants, serving as a reference group. The formula-fed infants were randomly assigned to receive HBP formula (43 % of the palmitic acid is esterified to the middle position of the glycerol backbone, study group; n = 30) or regular formula with low-beta palmitate (LBP, 14 % of the palmitic acid is esterified to the middle position of the glycerol backbone, n = 28). Sixty-six infants completed the 12-week study. Anthropometric and quantitative ultrasound measurements of bone SOS for assessment of bone strength were performed at randomization and at 6 and 12 weeks postnatal age. At randomization, gestational age, birth weight, and bone SOS were comparable between the three groups. At 12 weeks postnatal age, the mean bone SOS of the HBP group was significantly higher than that of the LBP group (2,896 +/- 133 vs. 2,825 +/- 79 m/s respectively, P = 0.049) and comparable with that of the breast-fed group (2,875 +/- 85 m/s). We concluded that infants consuming HBP formula had changes in bone SOS that were comparable to those of infants consuming breast milk and favorable compared to infants consuming LBP formula.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The TMPRSS2/ERG (T/E) fusion gene is present in half of all prostate cancer tumors. Fusion of the oncogenic ERG gene with the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 gene promoter results in expression of fusion mRNAs in prostate cancer cells. The junction of theTMPRSS2- and ERG-derived portions of the fusion mRNA constitutes a cancer-specific target in cells containing the T/E fusion gene. Targeting the most common alternatively spliced fusion gene mRNA junctional isoforms in vivo using siRNAs in liposomal nanovectors may potentially be a novel, low-toxicity treatment for prostate cancer.

  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We designed and optimized siRNAs targeting the two most common T/E fusion gene mRNA junctional isoforms (type III or type VI). Specificity of siRNAs was assessed by transient co-transfection in vitro. To test their ability to inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells expressing these fusion gene isoforms in vivo, specific siRNAs in liposomal nanovectors were used to treat mice bearing orthotopic or subcutaneous xenograft tumors expressing the targeted fusion isoforms.

  RESULTS: The targeting siRNAs were both potent and highly specific in vitro. In vivo they significantly inhibited tumor growth. The degree of growth inhibition was variable and was correlated with the extent of fusion gene knockdown. The growth inhibition was associated with marked inhibition of angiogenesis and, to a lesser degree, proliferation and a marked increase in apoptosis of tumor cells. No toxicity was observed.

  CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the T/E fusion junction in vivo with specific siRNAs delivered via liposomal nanovectors is a promising therapy for men with prostate cancer. 2012 AACR.

Abstract
  The survival benefit conferred by two hormonal agents in phase III trials has clinically validated the long suspected and now widely recognized phenomenon of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) hormone dependence. Abiraterone inhibits steroid 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) and blocks androgen synthesis, whereas enzalutamide directly binds and antagonizes the androgen receptor. Both agents are highly effective against CRPC and significantly prolong survival following docetaxel treatment. However, this clinical validation of the androgen pathway has led to questions regarding the fundamental mechanisms of CRPC, as well as resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Our understanding of the predominant steroid transformation pathways that lead to dihydrotestosterone synthesis in CRPC is evolving. The role of steroidogenesis in the development of resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide remains uncertain. The specific roles of candidate enzyme targets in the development of resistance to these agents must be defined if we are to identify novel targets for improved pharmacologic therapies.

Abstract
  Cardiovascular hypertrophy is a common feature of hypertension and an important risk factor for heart damage. The regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy is currently considered an important therapeutic target in reducing the omplications of hypertension. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy by probiotic-fermented purple sweet potato yogurt (PSPY) with high -aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) hearts. Six-week-old male SHRs were separated randomly and equally into 4 experimental groups: sterile water, captopril and 2 PSPY groups with different doses (10 and 100%) for 8 weeks. The changes in myocardial architecture and key molecules of the hypertrophy-related pathway in the excised left ventricle from these rats were determined by histopathological analysis, hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blot analysis. Abnormal myocardial architecture and enlarged interstitial spaces observed in the SHRs were significantly decreased in the captopril and PSPY groups compared with the sterile water group. Moreover, the increases in atrial natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, phosphorilated protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II levels in the left ventricle were accompanied by hypertension and increases in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 activities with enhanced cardiac hypertrophy. However, the protein levels of the hypertrophic-related pathways were completely reversed by the administration of PSPY. PSPY may repress the activation of ANP and BNP which subsequently inhibit the dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 3 and ultimately prevent the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract
  Prostate metabolism is unique, characterised by cholesterol accumulation and reduced respiration. Are these related? We modulated cholesterol levels and despite changes in mitochondrial cholesterol content, we saw no effects on lactate production or respiration. Instead, these features may be related via sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), the master transcriptional regulator of cholesterol synthesis. SREBP-2 diverts acetyl-CoA into cholesterol synthesis and may thus reduce respiration. We examined LNCaP cells overexpressing the SREBP-2 regulator, Scap: although having higher SREBP-2 activity, these cells displayed higher respiration. This striking observation warrants further investigation. Given that SREBP-2 and Scap are regulated by factors driving prostate growth, exploring this observation further could shed light on prostate carcinogenesis.

Abstract
  A proline-rich peptide product prepared from bovine whey protein that was enriched in several hydrophobic amino acids including proline (whey proline-rich peptide, wPRP) was shown to modulate the folding pathway of human amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (A42) into oligomers. Concentration-dependent changes in ThT-binding to Ab42 by wPRP indicated suppression of oligomerisation, that was supported by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Suppression of -sheet and specifically, anti-parallel -sheet structures by wPRP was demonstrated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, where evidence for capacity of wPRP to dissociate pre-existing -sheet structures in A42 was also apparent. Suppression of anti-parallel -sheets of oligomeric A42 was associated with rescue of yeast and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells providing important evidence for the association between anti-parallel -sheet structure and oligomer toxicity. It was proposed that the interaction of wPRP with A42 interfered with the anti-parallel folding pathway of oligomeric A42 and ultimately produced 'off-pathway' structures of lowered total -sheet content, with attenuated cellular toxicity.

Abstract
  Interferon alpha 2b (IFN-2b) is an important immune regulator widely used in clinic, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis, hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma, etc. The clinically used IFN-2b is generally produced by E.Coli, which lacks the post-translational O-glycosylation presents on naturally synthesized protein, and has a short serum half-life. In this study, a transgenic cassette pBCN-IFN-pA-CMV-EGFP was constructed, with a 5.2kb beta-casein regulation fragment from Jersey cow and a 6xHis tagged human Interferon alpha 2b (hIFN-2b) gene fragment. By using pronuclear microinjection technique, transgenic mice were generated and the expression of IFN-2b in the milk was assayed. The hIFN-2b was correctly translated in milk of transgenic mice according to Western blot analysis. The expression level of hIFN-2b was varied among the transgenic mice, and the highest one was about 29.71ug/L. The recombinant protein exhibited biological activity in vitro by increasing the luminescence value and the MxA gene expression in established WISH cells, and the specific activity is approximately 2.8x10(7)IU/mg. The expression of recombinant hIFN-2b in mammary glands of transgenic mice constitutes an important step towards low-cost and full biological activity production of this protein drug in mammary gland bioreactor.

Abstract
  The prostate gland is under androgen control. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of two genes that are regulators of the cell cycle, the p53 and p21 genes, in human non-transformed epithelial prostatic cells (HNTEPs) treated with different concentrations of hormones. Samples of prostate tissue were obtained from 10 patients between 60 and 77 years of age. HNTEP cells were grown in basal medium and treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in different conditions for 4 h. A low concentration of DHT resulted in a significant increase in cell growth; this effect was eradicated by addition of the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide. Furthermore, the low concentration of DHT induced lower mRNA levels in the p53 and p21 genes in HNTEP cells. In turn, high DHT concentrations induced a significant increase in the expression of the p53 and p21 genes. The present data suggest that the p53 and p21 genes play a role in the control of responsiveness and androgen dose-dependent cell proliferation in HNTEP cells. Further studies are required to assess the intracellular signaling pathway regulated by p53 and p21 under the influence of androgens and its implications for the pathophysiology of prostate diseases.

Abstract
  The presence of cells positive for cytokeratins or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in bone marrow aspirates (BMAs) has been used to indicate the presence of micrometastasis. The aim of this prospective study of prostate cancer patients was to determine the presence of prostate cells in blood and BMAs and to compare them with bone marrow biopsy touch prep samples. The results indicated that there was a satisfactory concordance between circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in blood and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in BMAs for all Gleason scores (k>0.50). However, neither were concordant with the presence of prostate cells in bone marrow biopsies except for high-grade tumors, Gleason 8 and 9. Phenotypic characteristics of CPCs and DTCs were identical (k>0.9) but were different than cells detected in bone marrow biopsies (k<0.2). The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in bone marrow biopsies was positively associated with the Gleason score (trend Chi-squared <0.05) and may explain the differences between the presence of DTCs and the presence of prostate cells in bone marrow biopsies. If the presence of DTCs was used to indicate micrometastatic disease, 20% of patients would be misclassified compared to micrometastasis defined as patients with a positive biopsy. This may have clinical implications for patients with low-grade tumors.

Abstract
  Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine -casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of -casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide -CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of mortality in men worldwide especially in developing countries like India. The molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic signaling pathway(s) that are involved in prostate carcinogenesis play a crucial role in disease progression and persistence. There is an important role of signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs) particularly STAT-3 and STAT-5 and its negative regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1).

  METHODS: In the present study, the expression and localization of STAT and SOCS-1 proteins in prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry in a total of 150 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human prostate tissues of different grade obtained by radical prostatectomies or transurethral resection.

  RESULTS: A significantly strong STAT-3 expression pattern in 68% (65/95) prostate cancer cases as compared to 12% (5/55) in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) controls (P < 0.001) was observed. Interestingly the SOCS-1 expression was found to be significantly elevated in prostate cancer cases (P < 0.001).

  CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates overexpression of STAT-3 and STAT-5 proteins and a contrasting role of SOCS-1 in prostate cancer. These results suggest a critical association between altered expression of STAT-3 and STAT-5 with SOCS-1 and indicate its potential role as a negative regulator independent of JAK-STAT pathway in tumorigenic transformation of prostate tissue. The results of the present report focuses on the fundamental differences in major oncogenic signaling cascades between benign and malignant form of prostate tissue that plays a crucial role in prostate cancer biology.

Abstract
  AIMS: TMPRSS2-ERG fusion resulting in strong Ets-related gene (ERG) overexpression occurs in about 50% of prostate cancers. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ERG overexpression in other tumour types as well as in normal tissues.

  METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 11 483 tumours and 72 different normal tissue types were analysed in a tissue microarray format. Strong nuclear ERG overexpression was found in 36.7% of prostate carcinomas as well as in various vascular tumours, including Kaposi sarcomas (91.7%), angiosarcomas (100%) and haemangiomas (90.9%). Moderate to strong nuclear ERG immunostaining was also observed in thymoma (6.1%). Weak to moderate ERG staining was found in a small number of squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, squamous carcinomas of the lung, malignant mesotheliomas, carcinosarcomas of the uterus, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, hepatocellular carcinomas, teratomas of the testis, anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid, giant cell tumours of the tendon sheath and benign fibrous histiocytomas of the skin. ERG overexpression was not seen in 8886 samples from 132 other tumour types and subtypes. Within normal tissues, immunohistochemically detectable ERG overexpression was restricted to endothelial cells and subsets of lymphocytes.

  CONCLUSIONS: The high specificity of ERG expression in both normal and neoplastic tissues suggests a very narrow biological role for ERG in highly selected tissues.  2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Despite significant advances in prostate cancer diagnosis and management, the molecular events involved in the transformation of normal prostate cells into cancer cells have not been fully understood. It is generally accepted that prostate cancer derives from the basal compartment while expressing luminal markers. We investigated whether downregulation of the basal protein B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) is implicated in prostate cancer transformation and progression. Here we show that BTG2 loss can shift normal prostate basal cells towards luminal markers expression, a phenotype also accompanied by the appearance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits. We also show that the overexpression of microRNA (miR)-21 suppresses BTG2 levels and promotes the acquisition of luminal markers and EMT in prostate cells. Furthermore, by using an innovative lentiviral vector able to compete with endogenous mRNA through the overexpression of the 3'-untranslated region of BTG2, we demonstrate that in prostate tumor cells, the levels of luminal and EMT markers can be reduced by derepression of BTG2 from microRNA-mediated control. Finally, we show that the loss of BTG2 expression confers to non-tumorigenic prostate cells ability to grow in an orthotopic murine model, thus demonstrating the central role of BTG2 downregulaton in prostate cancer biology.

Abstract
  Staphylococcal superantigen-like protein (SSL), a family of exotoxins composed of 14 SSLs, exhibits no superantigenic activity despite of its structural similarity with superantigens. Several SSLs have been revealed to bind to host immune molecules such as IgA, IgG, complement and cell surface molecules expressed on immune cells, but the physiological function of SSL family has not been fully identified. In this study we attempted to isolate host target proteins of SSLs from human breast milk using SSLs-conjugated Sepharose. SSL8-conjugated Sepharose specifically recovered tenascin C (TNC), a multimodular and multifunctional extracellular matrix protein. Pull down analysis using SSL8-conjugated Sepharose and recombinant truncated fragments of TNC revealed that SSL8 interacts with fibronectin (FN) type III repeats 1-5 of TNC. The interaction of TNC with immobilized FN was attenuated, the scratch wound closure by HaCaT human keratinocytes was delayed and the inhibition of cell spreading on FN by TNC was recovered in the presence of SSL8. These findings suggest that SSL8 binds to TNC, thereby inhibits the TNC-FN interaction and motility of keratinocytes. The present study added a novel role of SSL family protein as an interrupting molecule against the function of extracellular matrix. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a fatal, metastatic form of prostate cancer. CRPC is characterized by reactivation of the androgen axis due to changes in androgen receptor signaling and/or adaptive intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. AKR1C3 is upregulated in CRPC where it catalyzes the formation of potent androgens. This makes AKR1C3 a target for the treatment of CRPC. AKR1C3 inhibitors should not inhibit AKR1C1/AKR1C2, which inactivate 5-dihydrotestosterone. Indomethacin, used to inhibit cyclooxygenase, also inhibits AKR1C3 and displays selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2. Parallel synthetic strategies were used to generate libraries of indomethacin analogues, which exhibit reduced cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity but retain AKR1C3 inhibitory potency and selectivity. The lead compounds inhibited AKR1C3 with nanomolar potency, displayed >100-fold selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2, and blocked testosterone formation in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells. The AKR1C3.NADP(+).2'-des-methyl-indomethacin crystal structure was determined, and it revealed a unique inhibitor binding mode. The compounds reported are promising agents for the development of therapeutics for CRPC.

Abstract
  Cancer metastasis and immune suppression are critical issues in cancer therapy. Here, we show that a -galactoside-binding lectin [galectin-3 (gal3)] that recognizes the Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide (TFD, Gal1,3GalNAc) present on the surface of most cancer cells is involved in promoting angiogenesis, tumor-endothelial cell adhesion, and metastasis of prostate cancer cells, as well as evading immune surveillance through killing of activated T cells. To block gal3-mediated interactions, we purified a glycopeptide from cod (designated TFD100) that binds gal3 with picomolar affinity. TFD100 blocks gal3-mediated angiogenesis, tumor-endothelial cell interactions, and metastasis of prostate cancer cells in mice at nanomolar levels. Moreover, apoptosis of activated T cells induced by either recombinant gal3 or prostate cancer patient serum-associated gal3 was inhibited at nanomolar concentration of TFD100. Because the gal3-TFD interaction is a key factor driving metastasis in most epithelial cancers, this high-affinity TFD100 should be a promising antimetastatic agent for the treatment of various cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma.

Abstract
  High dairy protein intake has been found to be associated with increased prostate cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). To further examine this possible relationship, we investigated the hypothesis that a genetic polymorphism in the lactase (LCT) gene might be associated with elevated dairy product intake and increased prostate cancer risk in a case-control study nested in EPIC. The C/T-13910 lactase variant (rs4988235) was genotyped in 630 men with prostate cancer and 873 matched control participants. Dairy product consumption was assessed by diet questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) for prostate cancer in relation to lactase genotype were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Lactase genotype frequency varied significantly between countries, with frequencies of the T (lactase persistence) allele ranging from 7% in Greece to 79% in Denmark. Intake of milk and total dairy products varied significantly by lactase genotype after adjustment for recruitment center; adjusted mean intakes of milk were 44.4, 69.8 and 82.3 g/day among men with CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively. The lactase variant was not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk, both in our data (adjusted OR for TT vs. CC homozygotes: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.76-1.59) and in a meta-analysis of all the published data (combined OR for T allele carriers vs. CC homozygotes: 1.12, 0.96-1.32). These findings show that while variation in the lactase gene is associated with milk intake in men, the lactase polymorphism does not have a large effect on prostate cancer risk.

Abstract
  Aberrant activation of Wnts is common in human cancers, including prostate. Hypermethylation associated transcriptional silencing of Wnt antagonist genes SFRPs (Secreted Frizzled-Related Proteins) is a frequent oncogenic event. The significance of this is not known in prostate cancer. The objectives of our study were to (i) profile Wnt signaling related gene expression and (ii) investigate methylation of Wnt antagonist genes in prostate cancer. Using TaqMan Low Density Arrays, we identified 15 Wnt signaling related genes with significantly altered expression in prostate cancer; the majority of which were upregulated in tumors. Notably, histologically benign tissue from men with prostate cancer appeared more similar to tumor (r = 0.76) than to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; r = 0.57, p < 0.001). Overall, the expression profile was highly similar between tumors of high (>= 7) and low (<= 6) Gleason scores. Pharmacological demethylation of PC-3 cells with 5-Aza-CdR reactivated 39 genes (>= 2-fold); 40% of which inhibit Wnt signaling. Methylation frequencies in prostate cancer were 10% (2/20) (SFRP1), 64.86% (48/74) (SFRP2), 0% (0/20) (SFRP4) and 60% (12/20) (SFRP5). SFRP2 methylation was detected at significantly lower frequencies in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN; 30%, (6/20), p = 0.0096), tumor adjacent benign areas (8.82%, (7/69), p < 0.0001) and BPH (11.43% (4/35), p < 0.0001). The quantitative level of SFRP2 methylation (normalized index of methylation) was also significantly higher in tumors (116) than in the other samples (HGPIN = 7.45, HB = 0.47, and BPH = 0.12). We show that SFRP2 hypermethylation is a common event in prostate cancer. SFRP2 methylation in combination with other epigenetic markers may be a useful biomarker of prostate cancer.

Abstract
  The bovine mammary alveolar cell-T (MAC-T) cell line is able to uniformly differentiate and secrete casein proteins in response to dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin and is extensively used to study bovine mammary epithelial cell (MEC) function. Somatotropin, or growth hormone (GH), has been shown to increase milk protein synthesis both in vivo and in mammary cell models and to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement in a 3T3 fibroblast cell line and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. To identify the nature of the effects of GH in MECs cultured with lactogenic hormones, changes in global protein expression were assessed in the MAC-T cell line with the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time of flight mass spectrometry. Forty proteins were differentially expressed in response to GH (P < 0.05) and were related to metabolism, the cytoskeleton, protein folding, RNA and DNA processing, and oxidant stress. These widespread changes in protein expression are indicative of a global role of GH in overall cellular differentiation that may underlie the direct modulation of milk component synthesis in MEC models that have been described to date.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor (AR) signalling is critical to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Transcriptional activity of AR involves chromatin recruitment of co-activators, including the p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). Distinct miRNA expression profiles have been identified in PCa cells during the development and progression of the disease. Whether miRNAs regulate PCAF expression in PCa cells to regulate AR transcriptional activity is still unclear.

  METHODS: Expression of PCAF was investigated in several PCa cell lines by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. The effects of PCAF expression on AR-regulated transcriptional activity and cell growth in PCa cells were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, reporter gene construct analysis, and MTS assay. Targeting of PCAF by miR-17-5p was evaluated using the luciferase reporter assay.

  RESULTS: PCAF was upregulated in several PCa cell lines. Upregulation of PCAF promoted AR transcriptional activation and cell growth in cultured PCa cells. Expression of PCAF in PCa cells was associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p. Targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of PCAF mRNA by miR-17-5p caused translational suppression and RNA degradation, and, consequently, modulation of AR transcriptional activity in PCa cells.

  CONCLUSIONS: PCAF is upregulated in cultured PCa cells, and upregulation of PCAF is associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p. Targeting of PCAF by miR-17-5p modulates AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in cultured PCa cells.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. VEGF is believed to implicate poor prognosis in various cancers. The overexpression of VEGF may be an early step in the process of metastasis.

  METHODS: ELISA was used to investigate the levels of VEGF, bFGF and IL8 in human bone metastatic LNCaP-derivative C4-2B prostate cancer cell line and its parental cell line, LNCaP and to determine the effect of bevacizumab on reducing the level of VEGF. Cell proliferation assay, invasion assay and in vitro angiogenesis assay were performed under the condition with bevacizumab or control IgG.

  RESULTS: Human bone metastatic LNCaP-derivative C4-2B prostate cancer cell line expressed a higher level of VEGF than its parental primary prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. The effect of bevacizumab is dose-dependent and time-dependent: 100 ug/mL of bevacizumab and 3-day treatment was more effective than low-dose and lesser-day treatment for decreasing the level of VEGF. Bevacizumab is able to suppress cell proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion in human bone metastatic C4-2B prostatic cancer cell line.

  CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of VEGF can be inhibited by bevacizumab in human bone metastatic cancer cell line. The behaviors of metastasis involving proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion are suppressed by anti-VEGF therapy.

Abstract
  The molecular mechanism that controls the proliferation and differentiation of prostate epithelial cells is currently unknown. We previously identified a 44-kDa protein (p44/wdr77) as an androgen receptor-interacting protein that regulates a set of androgen receptor target genes in prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer. In this study, we found that p44 localizes in the cytoplasm of prostate epithelial cells at the early stage of prostate development when cells are proliferating, and its nuclear translocation is associated with cellular and functional differentiation in adult prostate tissue. We further demonstrated that cytoplasmic p44 protein is essential for proliferation of prostate epithelial cells, whereas nuclear p44 is required for cell differentiation and prostate- specific protein secretion. These studies suggest a novel mechanism by which proliferation and differentiation of prostate epithelial cells are controlled by p44's location in the cell.

Abstract
  Metastatic progression is a multistep process that involves tumor growth and survival, motility and invasion, and subsequent proliferation in an inappropriate environment. The Src protein tyrosine kinase has been implicated in many of the biochemical pathways that drive these behaviors. Although Src itself is only rarely mutated in human tumors, its aberrant activity has been noted in various cancers and suggested to serve as a barometer of metastatic potential. With these features in mind, we examined Src kinase regulation at the structural, enzymatic, and expression levels as a function of progressively invasive prostate cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, both total Src content and kinase activity decrease with increasing cell line aggressiveness, an observation that appears to be inconsistent with the well-documented role of Src in the signaling pathways that drive growth and invasion. However, we do observe a direct correlation between Src kinase specific activity (total Src kinase activity/total Src content) and metastatic aggressiveness, possibly suggesting that in highly aggressive cell lines, key signaling enzymes are globally recruited to drive the cancerous phenotype. In addition, although the expected enhanced phosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416 (activation site) is present in the most aggressive prostate cancer cell lines, unexpectedly high phosphorylation levels at the Tyr-527 inhibitory site are observed as well. The latter, rather than representative of inhibited enzyme, is more indicative of primed Src responsive to local phosphorylated binding partners.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Androgen receptor is an essential transcriptional factor that contributes to the development and progression of prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the androgen regulation and functional analysis of 14-3-3 in prostate cancer.

  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) analysis in LNCaP cells, we identified a functional androgen receptor-binding site in the downstream region of the 14-3-3 gene. Androgen regulation was examined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis. Prostate cancer cells stably expressing 14-3-3 and siRNA knockdown were used for functional analyses. We further examined 14-3-3 expression in clinical samples of prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR.

  RESULTS: Androgen-dependent upregulation of 14-3-3 was validated at the mRNA and protein levels. The 14-3-3 gene is favorable for cancer-cell survival, as its ectopic expression in LNCaP cells contributes to cell proliferation and the acquired resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis. 14-3-3 expression was associated with androgen receptor transcriptional activity and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA expression. Immunoprecipitation indicated that 14-3-3 was associated with androgen receptor in the nucleus. Clinicopathologic studies further support the relevance of 14-3-3 in prostate cancers, as its higher expression is associated with malignancy and lymph node metastasis.

  CONCLUSIONS: 14-3-3 is a novel androgen-responsive gene that activates proliferation, cell survival, and androgen receptor transcriptional activity. 14-3-3 may facilitate the progression of prostate cancer. 2012 AACR

Abstract
  Milk fat globules (MFGs) secreted by lactating mammary gland are unique lipid surrounded by a phospholipid bi-layer. We report here post-weaning changes in MFG EGF factor VIII (MFG-E8) and annexin V-accessible phosphatidyl-l-serine on the surface of MFGs. The MFG content in milk markedly decreased to about one-half within 2 days after forced weaning, despite a slight increase in milk protein content. Immunofluorescence-staining of MFGs using anti-MFG-E8 and annexin V indicated that MFG-E8 was present on some, but not all, MFGs before weaning, whereas most of MFGs were MFG-E8-positive and annexin V-negative after weaning. Free MFG-E8 with binding activity to phosphatidyl-l-serine was present abundantly in the post-weaning milk, and indeed exhibited binding to MFGs in pre-weaning milk. MFGs were taken up by HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro, and those from post-weaning milk were remarkable for such cellular uptake. Moreover, the uptake of MFGs by the cells was inhibited by an anti-MFG-E8 antibody. Taken together, these findings suggest that MFG-E8 plays a critical role in regulation of MFG dynamics after weaning or during the suckling interval through the control of MFG-epithelial cell interaction in lactating mammary glands.

Abstract
  Although most eukaryotes reproduce sexually at some moment of their life cycle, as much as a fifth of fungal species were thought to reproduce exclusively asexually. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed the occurrence of sex in some of these supposedly asexual species. For industrially relevant fungi, for which inoculums are produced by clonal-subcultures since decades, the potentiality for sex is of great interest for strain improvement strategies. Here, we investigated the sexual capability of the fungus Penicillium roqueforti, used as starter for blue cheese production. We present indirect evidence suggesting that recombination could be occurring in this species. The screening of a large sample of strains isolated from diverse substrates throughout the world revealed the existence of individuals of both mating types, even in the very same cheese. The MAT genes, involved in fungal sexual compatibility, appeared to evolve under purifying selection, suggesting that they are still functional. The examination of the recently sequenced genome of the FM 164 cheese strain enabled the identification of the most important genes known to be involved in meiosis, which were found to be highly conserved. Linkage disequilibria were not significant among three of the six marker pairs and 11 out of the 16 possible allelic combinations were found in the dataset. Finally, the detection of signatures of repeat induced point mutations (RIP) in repeated sequences and transposable elements reinforces the conclusion that P. roqueforti underwent more or less recent sex events. In this species of high industrial importance, the induction of a sexual cycle would open the possibility of generating new genotypes that would be extremely useful to diversify cheese products.

Abstract
  Understanding the mechanism underlying the regulation of the androgen receptor (AR), a central player in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), holds promise for overcoming the challenge of treating CRPC. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 targets a select pool of NCOR1-bound, transcriptionally-inactive AR for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting expression of select AR target genes implicated in lipid metabolism, cell motility, and proliferation. Siah2 is required for prostate cancer cell growth under androgen-deprivation conditions in vitro and in vivo, and Siah2 inhibition promotes prostate cancer regression upon castration. Notably, Siah2 expression is markedly increased in human CRPCs. Collectively, we find that selective regulation of AR transcriptional activity by the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 is important for CRPC development. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Overexpression of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) frequently occurs during the progression of prostate cancer (PC) to androgen-independent (AI) and metastatic disease states and is associated with a poor outcome of patients.

  METHODS: The gain- and loss-of-function analyses of MIC-1 were performed to establish its implications for aggressive and chemoresistant phenotypes of metastatic and AI PC cells and the benefit of its downregulation for reversing docetaxel resistance.

  RESULTS: The results have indicated that an enhanced level of secreted MIC-1 protein in PC3 cells is associated with their acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition features and higher invasive capacity and docetaxel resistance. Importantly, the downregulation of MIC-1 in LNCaP-LN3 and PC3M-LN4 cells significantly decreased their invasive capacity and promoted the antiproliferative, anti-invasive and mitochrondrial- and caspase-dependent apoptotic effects induced by docetaxel. The downregulation of MIC-1 in PC3M-LN4 cells was also effective in promoting the cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel on the side population (SP) endowed with stem cell-like properties and the non-SP cell fraction from PC3M-LN4 cells.

  CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the downregulation of MIC-1 may constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of current docetaxel-based chemotherapies, eradicating the total mass of PC cells and thereby preventing disease relapse and the death of PC patients.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the percentage change in volume of prostate cancer, as assessed by T2-weighted MRI, following exposure to dutasteride (Avodart) 0.5mg daily for six months.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRI in Primary Prostate cancer after Exposure to Dutasteride (MAPPED) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Men with prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance (low-intermediate risk prostate cancer on biopsy), and a visible lesion on T2-weighted MRI of at least 0.2 cc, were eligible for consideration. Forty-two men were randomised to 6 months of daily dutasteride 0.5mg or placebo. Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The percentage changes in cancer volume over time will be compared between the dutasteride and placebo groups. Planned analyses will examine the association between tumour volume and characteristics (perfusion and contrast washout) as seen on mpMRI, HistoScan ultrasound and biopsy histopathology in both groups.

  DISCUSSION: MAPPED is the first randomised controlled trial to use mpMRI to look at the effect of dutasteride on the volume of prostate cancer. If dutasteride is shown to reduce the volume of prostate cancer, it might be considered as an adjunct for men on active surveillance. Analysis of the placebo arm will allow us to comment on the short-term natural variability of the MR appearance in men who are not receiving any treatment.

  CONCLUSION: MAPPED will evaluate the short-term effect of dutasteride on prostate cancer volume, as assessed by mpMRI, in men undergoing active surveillance for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer.

Abstract
  We designed and synthesized a series of 3-aryl-3-hydroxy-1-phenylpyrrolidine derivatives D and evaluated their potential as novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonists therapeutically effective against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Introduction of a methyl group at the 2-position (R(2)) of the pyrrolidine ring increased the AR binding affinity. The (2S,3R) configuration of the pyrrolidine ring was favorable for the AR antagonistic activity. It was found that introduction of an amide substituent (R(1)) and a pyridin-3-yl group (Q) was effective for reducing the AR agonistic activity which appeared during the optimization of lead compound 6. Compound 54 showed potent antitumor effects against a CRPC model of LNCaP-hr cell line in a mouse xenograft, in which bicalutamide exhibited only partial suppression of tumor growth. Thus, the pyrrolidine derivatives such as 54 are novel AR antagonists, and their properties having efficacy against CRPC are distinct from those of a representative first-generation antagonist, bicalutamide.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 18F-choline PET/CT (18FCH-PET/CT) in restaging patients previously treated by radical prostatectomy for a prostate cancer, presenting with biochemical relapse during follow-up (FU).

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred thirty-one patients referred to us from January 2009 to April 2011 to perform 18FCH PET/CT were evaluated: 233 of them (mean age 69.7 years) met the inclusion criteria of the study: (1) biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy (trigger PSA>0.2 ng/mL) (n=224) and (2) high risk for relapse (elevated Gleason score>=8) in spite PSA<0.1 ng/mL during FU (n=9). Trigger PSA was available for all patients (mean 8 ng/mL) and in 44 of them also PSA kinetic (PSA velocity-PSAvel; PSA doubling time-PSAdt). Correlation between 18FCH PET/CT detection rate and trigger PSA, PSAvel, PSAdt, and tumoral spread distribution were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Subsequent minimum FU was 1 year (mean 26 months, range 12-40).

  RESULTS: Overall detection rate of 18FCH PET/CT was 54%, which significantly increased when the trigger PSA increases (P<0.001). PET-positive patients presented a "fast" PSA kinetic (mean PSAdt=6 months and mean PSAvel=9.3 ng/mL/yr), while PET-negative patients presented a "slow" PSA kinetic (mean PSAdt=15.4 months and mean PSAvel=0.9 ng/mL/yr). Disease relapse was local in 17% of cases, distant in 66%, and combined in 17%.

  CONCLUSIONS: Overall 18FCH PET/CT detection rate was 54% (ie, similar to that reported in literature with 11C-choline), which increases with the increase in trigger PSA: this condition was particularly true in patients with accelerated PSA kinetic. In about 20% of patients, 18FCH PET/CT demonstrated local relapses early enough to offer locoregional radiation therapy.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: A pilot study from our group suggests that the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among dairy farmers is higher than in the general population although dairy workers are less frequently smokers.

  OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The study presented here aims at (i) determining the prevalence of COPD in a large and representative population of dairy farmers; (ii) characterizing these patients in terms of smoking habits, dyspnoea, quality of life, lung function, bronchial exhaled nitric oxide, systemic inflammation, arterial stiffness and exercise capacity; (iii) comparing characteristics of dairy farmers' COPD with the characteristics of COPD in patients without any occupational exposure; (iv) identifying the etiological factors of COPD in dairy farmers; and (v) constituting a cohort of COPD patients and control subjects for further longitudinal studies. Two groups of COPD patients (dairy farmers or not) and two groups of controls subjects will be selected among a representative panel of 2000dairy workers and 2000subjects without any occupational exposure, all aged 40to 75years.

  EXPECTED RESULTS: A better knowledge of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COPD in dairy farmers should guide a specific strategy of prevention. The knowledge of the characteristics of COPD occurring in dairy farmers will help to define the therapeutic modalities that might be different compared with the therapeutic recommendations for COPD secondary to tobacco smoking.

Abstract
  The dairy industry disposes of a large volume of waste milk with antibiotic residues, which is a great cause of much concern in soil and water environments. In this study, the electrochemical oxidation of tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) in cow's milk was investigated. Milk contains a high concentration of organic matter, and the concentrations of TCs residues are extremely low. The effects of anode materials and electrolytes on the degradation of oxytetracycline (OTC) were investigated. A higher degradation rate for the OTC was attained using the inactive anode or a NaCl electrolyte. It was found that a physically adsorbed oxidant on the surface of the anode and indirect oxidation using electrogenerated hypochlorite could enhance the degradation of OTC in raw milk. The organic components in milk samples affected the removal rate of the OTC. The removal rate constants for the OTC in raw milk were 2.8-7.7 times higher than the chemical oxygen demand values. It was found that electrochemical oxidation could decompose low concentrations of TCs in high concentrations of organic matter solutions selectively. The results indicate that electrochemical oxidation is an effective method for the treatment of TCs in waste milk. Copyright  2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Some epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin A (retinol), vitamin E, and vitamin D (total 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin, 1,25(OH)(2)D) are protective against prostate cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive, with positive and null associations reported for all three vitamins. Limitations of previous studies include small sample size, lack of population controls, and reliance on self-reported dietary intake. Few studies have explored the interactions of circulating 25(OH)D with 1,25(OH)(2)D or retinol, which are biologically plausible interactions.

  METHODS: We investigated the associations of circulating retinol, vitamin E, and 1,25(OH)(2)D with PSA-detected prostate cancer risk, stage, and grade in a case-control study nested within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial. We investigated the possibility of an interaction between 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D and whether the previously observed association between 25(OH)D and prostate cancer may be modified by retinol levels.

  RESULTS: We included 1,433 prostate cancer cases and 1,433 healthy controls. There was no evidence of associations of circulating retinol, vitamin E, or 1,25(OH)(2)D with overall prostate cancer risk, stage (advanced vs localized), or Gleason grade (high- (>=7) vs low (<7) grade). There was no evidence of an interaction of 1,25(OH)(2)D and 25(OH)D with prostate cancer risk, stage, or grade (p interaction >= 0.24). The association between 25(OH)D and prostate cancer did not differ by retinol level (p interaction = 0.34).

  CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that retinol, vitamin E, or 1,25(OH)(2)D concentrations were associated with overall prostate cancer risk or more aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes. There was no evidence of an interaction between 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D or retinol.

Abstract
  RNA-Seq is a recently developed tool to characterize transcriptomes using a massively parallel sequencing technique. In spite of its broad usage in gene expression profiling, RNA-Seq can also be used to discover single nucleotide variants in transcribed regions. Here we report the result of an analysis of transcriptome sequencing data of 5 human prostate cancer tissues. A total of 116 disruptive mutations (frameshift indels or nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions) in 92 genes are revealed with high confidence. Among these genes, several candidates are of particular interest. For example, a frameshift insertion/deletion (indel) is found in the coding region of TNFSF10, which disrupts the intact open reading frame and undermines the ability of TNFSF10 to induce apoptosis, in consequence promoting abnormal tumor progression. In summary, our findings demonstrate the use of RNA-Seq in somatic mutation screening, and provide a list of candidate genes which can be used in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract
  Platelets play a major role in hemostasis, but are also involved in vascular biology processes such as angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Activated platelets release many proteins favoring wound healing and promoting angiogenesis. Microparticles (MP) are small plasma membrane vesicles shed from cells upon their activation or apoptosis. Platelet-derived microparticles (PMP) constitute the majority of the pool of MP circulating in the blood. PMP express and may transfer functional receptors, stimulate the release of cytokines, activate intracellular signaling pathways, promote angiogenesis, and are involved in tissue regeneration and cancer metastasis. We investigated the effect of PMP on cancer cells metastasis and their potential beneficial effect in an ischemic stroke model. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  The particular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment have the potential to strongly promote tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis and induce drug resistance. Therefore, the development of effective, systemic therapeutic approaches specifically based on the tumor microenvironment is highly desirable. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is an attractive therapeutic target because it is a key transcription factor in tumor development and only accumulates in hypoxic tumors. We report here that a cationic mixed micellar nanoparticle (MNP) consisting of amphiphilic block copolymers poly(-caprolactone)-block-poly(2-aminoethylethylene phosphate) (PCL(29)-b-PPEEA(21)) and poly(-caprolactone)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PCL(40)-b-PEG(45)) was a suitable carrier for HIF-1 siRNA to treat hypoxic tumors, which showed an average diameter of 58.0 +/- 3.4 nm. The complex MNP(siRNA), formed by the interaction of MNP and siRNA, was transfected into PC3 prostate cancer cells efficiently, while the inhibition of HIF-1 expression by MNP loaded with HIF-1 siRNA (MNP(siHIF)) blocked PC3 cell proliferation, suppressed cell migration and disturbed angiogenesis under in vitro hypoxic mimicking conditions. It was further demonstrated that systemic delivery of MNP(siHIF) effectively inhibited tumor growth in a PC3 prostate cancer xenograft murine model without activating innate immune responses. Moreover, delivery of MNP(siHIF) sensitized PC3 tumor cells to doxorubicin chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo by downregulating MDR1 gene expression which was induced by hypoxia. The underlying concept of use of MNP(siHIF) to block HIF-1 holds promise as an example of a clinical approach using specific siRNA therapy for cancer treatment aimed at the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: Alterations in the methylation patterns of promoter CpG islands have been associated with the transcriptional inhibition of genes in many human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa).

  OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of aberrant promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor 2 (RAR2) gene in serum DNA samples from patients with the diagnosis of PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as a new epigenetic biomarker in distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant lesions.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aberrant promoter hypermethylation was investigated in genomic DNA isolated from the serum of 91 patients diagnosed with of PCa and 94 with BPH (control subjects). In order to evaluate the methylation status of the RAR2 gene we used the quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) method.

  RESULTS: Promoter hypermethylation of RAR2 gene was detected in serum samples from 89 of 91 (92.86%) patients with PCa, and in 10 of the 94 (10.7%) patients with BPH.

  CONCLUSIONS: RAR2 represents a promising molecular biomarker which may be used in discriminating between malignant and benign prostatic diseases by noninvasive methods. Celsius.

Abstract
  The casein fraction of 13 Portuguese PDO cheeses were analysed using Urea-PAGE and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and then subjected to chemometric evaluation. The chemometric techniques of cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used for the classification studies. Peptide mapping using Urea-PAGE followed by CA revealed two major clusters according to the similarity of the proteolytic profile of the cheeses. PCA results were in accordance with the grouping performed using CA. CA of RP-HPLC results of the matured cheeses revealed the presence of one major cluster comprising samples manufactured with only ovine milk or milk admixtures. When the results of CA technique were compared with the two PCA approaches performed, it was found that the grouping of the samples was similar. Both approaches, revealed the potential of proteolytic profiles (which is an essential aspect of cheese maturation) as markers of authenticity of PDO cheeses in terms of ripening time and milk admixtures not mentioned on the label.

Abstract
  Heat pre-treated and non heat pre-treated whey protein isolate (WPI) were hydrolysed using -chymotrypsin (chymotrypsin), pepsin and trypsin. The in vitro antioxidant activity, ACE-inhibition activity and surface hydrophobicities of the hydrolysates were measured in order to determine if peptides with dual functionalities were present. Dual functional peptides have both biological (e.g. antioxidant, ACE-inhibition, opioid activities) and technological (e.g. nanoemulsification abilities) functions in food systems. Heat pre-treatment marginally enhanced the hydrolysis of WPI by pepsin and trypsin but had no effect on WPI hydrolysis with chymotrypsin. With the exception of the hydrolysis by trypsin, heat pre-treatment did not affect the peptide profile of the hydrolysates as analysed using size exclusion chromatography, or the antioxidant activity (P>0.05). Heat pre-treatment significantly affected the ACE-inhibition activities and the surface hydrophobicities of the hydrolysates (P<0.05), which was a function of the specificity of the hydrolysing enzyme. Extended hydrolysis (up to 24 h) had no significant effect on the DH and the molecular weight profiles (P>0.05) but in some instances caused a reduction in the antioxidant activity of WPI hydrolysates. The chymotrypsin hydrolysate showed a broad MW size range, and was followed by pepsin and then trypsin. The bioactivities of the hydrolysates generally decreased in the order; chymotrypsin>trypsin>pepsin. This study showed that by manipulating protein conformation with pre-hydrolysis heat treatment, combined with careful enzyme selection, peptides with dual functionalities can be produced from WPI for use as functional ingredients in the manufacture of functional foods.

Abstract
  Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; cis-9,trans-11 18:2), a bioactive fatty acid (FA) found in milk and dairy products, has potential human health benefits due to its anticarcinogenic and antiatherogenic properties. Conjugated linoleic acid concentrations in milk fat can be markedly increased by dietary manipulation; however, high levels of CLA are difficult to sustain as rumen biohydrogenation shifts and milk fat depression (MFD) is often induced. Our objective was to feed a typical Northeastern corn-based diet and investigate whether vitamin E and soybean oil supplementation would sustain an enhanced milk fat CLA content while avoiding MFD. Holstein cows (n=48) were assigned to a completely randomized block design with repeated measures for 28 d and received 1 of 4 dietary treatments: (1) control (CON), (2) 10,000 IU of vitamin E/d (VE), (3) 2.5% soybean oil (SO), and (4) 2.5% soybean oil plus 10,000 IU of vitamin E/d (SO-VE). A 2-wk pretreatment control diet served as the covariate. Milk fat percentage was reduced by both high-oil diets (3.53, 3.56, 2.94, and 2.92% for CON, VE, SO, and SO-VE), whereas milk yield increased significantly for the SO-VE diet only, thus partially mitigating MFD by oil feeding. Milk protein percentage was higher for cows fed the SO diet (3.04, 3.05, 3.28, and 3.03% for CON, VE, SO, and SO-VE), implying that nutrient partitioning or ruminal supply of microbial protein was altered in response to the reduction in milk fat. Milk fat concentration of CLA more than doubled in cows fed the diets supplemented with soybean oil, with concurrent increases in trans-10 18:1 and trans-11 18:1 FA. Moreover, milk fat from cows fed the 2 soybean oil diets had 39.1% less de novo synthesized FA and 33.8% more long-chain preformed FA, and vitamin E had no effect on milk fat composition. Overall, dietary supplements of soybean oil caused a reduction in milk fat percentage and a shift in FA composition characteristic of MFD. Supplementing diets with vitamin E did not overcome the oil-induced reduction in milk fat percentage or changes in FA profile, but partially mitigated the reduction in fat yield by increasing milk yield.

Abstract
  The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; 4.5 g of cis-9,trans-11 C18:2 and 4.5 g of trans-10,cis-12 C18:2) on milk performance, milk fatty acid (FA) composition, and adipose tissue reactivity in dairy goats fed a high-concentrate diet based on corn silage. Twenty-four multiparous dairy goats in early to mid lactation were used in a 10-wk trial, with a 3-wk adaptation to the experimental total mixed ration that contained corn silage (35%, dry matter basis), beet pulp (20%), barley (15%), and a commercial concentrate (30%). Goats were randomly allocated to 2 experimental groups and they were fed 45 g/d of a lipid supplement (either CLA or Ca salts of palm oil added on top of the total mixed ration). Individual milk production and composition were recorded weekly, and milk FA composition was analyzed in wk 2, 5, and 6. In the last week of the trial, an isoproterenol challenge was performed for 12 goats before morning feeding. The CLA supplementation had no effect on dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW), milk yield, milk protein content, and lactose yield and content, but it significantly decreased milk fat yield and content by 18 and 15%, respectively. The decrease in milk fat yield was related to a lower secretion of FA synthesized de novo, of the medium-chain FA, and to a lesser extent of the long-chain FA that are taken up from the peripheral circulation. The CLA supplementation decreased the proportion of the sum of C16:0 and C16:1 and the sum of total cis C18:1, and it increased the proportions of the sum of long-chain (C >16) and the sum of iso FA without modification of the total trans C18:1 and the sum of FA synthesized de novo (C <16). During the first 25 min relative to isoproterenol injection, the maximal concentrations, the increases above basal concentration, the changes in area under the curve, and the total area under the curve for glucose and nonesterified FA were not affected by CLA treatment. In conclusion, CLA supplementation associated with a high-concentrate diet based on corn silage resulted in decreased milk fat yield, increased net energy balance, and it did not affect the sensitivity of the adipose tissue to lipolytic challenge in lactating goats.

Abstract
  Samples of fresh skim milk, reconstituted micellar casein, and casein powder were sonicated at 20 kHz to investigate the effect of ultrasonication. For fresh skim milk, the average size of the remaining fat globules was reduced by approximately 10 nm after 60 min of sonication; however, the size of the casein micelles was determined to be unchanged. A small increase in soluble whey protein and a corresponding decrease in viscosity also occurred within the first few minutes of sonication, which could be attributed to the breakup of casein-whey protein aggregates. No measurable changes in free casein content could be detected in ultracentrifuged skim milk samples sonicated for up to 60 min. A small, temporary decrease in pH resulted from sonication; however, no measurable change in soluble calcium concentration was observed. Therefore, casein micelles in fresh skim milk were stable during the exposure to ultrasonication. Similar results were obtained for reconstituted micellar casein, whereas larger viscosity changes were observed as whey protein content was increased. Controlled application of ultrasound can be usefully applied to reverse process-induced protein aggregation without affecting the native state of casein micelles.

Abstract
  The aim of this study was to elucidate the structure of relationships between milk yield, composition, and coagulation properties of Brown Swiss cattle. Multivariate factor analysis was used to derive new synthetic variables that can be used for selection purposes. For this reason, genetic parameters of these new variables were estimated. Individual records on milk yield, fat and protein percentages, casein content, lactose percentage, somatic cell count, titratable acidity, and pH were taken on 1,200 Italian Brown Swiss cows located in 38 herds. Factor analysis was able to extract 4 latent variables with an associated communality equal to 70% of the total original variance. The 4 latent factors were interpreted as indicators of milk composition, coagulation, acidity, and mammary gland health, respectively. Factor scores calculated for each animal exhibited coherent patterns along the lactation and across different parities. Estimation of genetic parameters of factor scores carried out with a multiple-trait Bayesian hierarchical model showed moderate to low heritabilities (raging from 0.10 to 0.23) and genetic correlations (from -0.15 to 0.46). Results of the present study support the hypothesis of a simpler structure that controls, at least in part, the covariance of milk composition and coagulation properties. Moreover, extracted variables may be useful for both breeding and management purposes, being able to represent, with a single value for each animal, complex traits such as milk coagulation properties or health status of the mammary gland.

Abstract
  Cow energy balance is known to be associated with cow health and fertility; therefore, routine access to data on energy balance can be useful in both management and breeding decisions to improve cow performance. The objective of this study was to determine if individual cow milk mid-infrared spectra (MIR) could be useful to predict cow energy balance across contrasting production systems. Direct energy balance was calculated as the differential between energy intake and energy output in milk and maintenance (maintenance was predicted using body weight). Body energy content was calculated from (change in) body weight and body condition score. Following editing, 2,992 morning, 2,742 midday, and 2,989 evening milk MIR records from 564 lactations on 337 Scottish cows, managed in a confinement system on 1 of 2 diets, were available. An additional 844 morning and 820 evening milk spectral records from 338 lactations on 244 Irish cows offered a predominantly grazed grass diet were also available. Equations were developed to predict body energy status using the milk spectral data and milk yield as predictor variables. Several different approaches were used to test the robustness of the equations calibrated in one data set and validated in another. The analyses clearly showed that the variation in the validation data set must be represented in the calibration data set. The accuracy (i.e., square root of the coefficient of multiple determinations) of predicting, from MIR, direct energy balance, body energy content, and energy intake was 0.47 to 0.69, 0.51 to 0.56, and 0.76 to 0.80, respectively. This highlights the ability of milk MIR to predict body energy balance, energy content, and energy intake with reasonable accuracy. Very high accuracy, however, was not expected, given the likely random errors in the calculation of these energy status traits using field data. Copyright  2012 American Dairy Science Association.

Abstract
  Negative energy balance is a known risk factor for decreased fertility in dairy cows. This study evaluated the accuracy of plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), -hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-factors related to negative energy balance-in predicting decreased fertility. One plasma sample per cow was collected from 480 cows in 12 herds during the period from d 4 to 21 in milk and analyzed for NEFA, BHBA, and IGF-1. For each cow, data on breed, parity, calving date, gynecological examinations, and insemination dates were obtained. Milk samples from 241 cows in 7 of the participating herds were analyzed for progesterone concentration to define the first day of luteal activity. The diagnostic sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) at different cut-off concentrations of NEFA, BHBA, or IGF-1 were calculated and related to individual cow fertility status, measured as anestrus (ANEST), delayed first artificial insemination (DFAI), or delayed conception. Positive and negative predictive values (PV+; PV-) were calculated considering different levels of (within-herd) prevalence. Strata (i.e., subgroup)-specific Se and Sp and associations between test results and fertility parameters were investigated using logistic regression. The NEFA and BHBA tests for ANEST and DFAI had the highest combined Se and Sp and were thus evaluated further. Cut-off values with Sp around 80% were used in this step to provide a reasonable number of test-positive cows, representing a practical situation. This corresponded to a cut-off value for the NEFA test of 400 Eq/L (Se 0.27-0.45) and for the BHBA test of 1.8mM (Se 0.15-0.30) across all cows included in the study. The estimated Sp was generally higher than the original 80%, but the corresponding Se was further decreased when the test was used in heifers compared with older cows. The true prevalence of ANEST in the study population was 27%, which gave a PV+ of 0.36 to 0.45 and a PV- of 0.76 to 0.79. With 35% true prevalence of DFAI, PV+ was 0.29 to 0.38 and PV- was 0.64 to 0.66. Thus, overall test performance was low when metabolic indicators measured as single values in early lactation were used to predict fertility in dairy cows, but accuracy was influenced by cow-level factors such as parity. The prevalence of the target condition (in this case, decreased fertility) also influences test usefulness and should be considered when planning test systems and interpreting test results.

Abstract
  Changes in the distribution of conjugated linoleic (CLA) and conjugated linolenic (CLnA) acid isomers in milk from Holstein cows in response to 4 different oilseed supplements rich in either cis-9 18:1 or 18:3n-3 were determined over 2 consecutive lactations in 58 and 35 cows during the first and second years, respectively. For the first 5 wk of the first lactation, all cows were fed the same diet. Thereafter, cows received 1 of 5 treatments for 2 consecutive lactations, including the prepartum period. Treatments comprised the basal diet with no additional lipid, or supplements of extruded linseeds (EL), extruded rapeseeds (ER), cold-pressed fat-rich rapeseed meal, or whole unprocessed rapeseeds to provide 2.5 to 3.0% of additional oil in diet dry matter. During indoor periods, cows were housed and received a mixture (3:1, wt/wt) of grass silage and hay, whereas cows were at pasture during outdoor periods. Over the entire study, EL resulted in the enrichment of 11,13 CLA, 12,14 CLA, trans-9,trans-11 CLA, trans-13,trans-15 CLA, 9,11,15 CLnA, and cis-9,trans-11,trans-13 CLnA (identified for the first time in bovine milk fat) in milk fat, whereas ER and cold-pressed fat-rich rapeseed meal in particular, increased milk fat trans-7,cis-9 CLA concentration. With the exception of the first indoor period, whole unprocessed rapeseeds decreased cis-9,trans-11 CLA, trans-9,cis-11 CLA, and trans-10,trans-12 CLA abundance. During the second indoor period, EL increased milk trans-9,cis-11 CLA and trans-10,cis-12 CLA concentrations, but the increases in cis-9,trans-11 CLA, cis-12,trans-14 CLA, trans-11,cis-13 CLA, and cis-9,trans-11,cis-15 CLnA concentrations to EL and ER were lower for the second than first indoor period. In contrast to the indoor periods, EL and ER decreased milk cis-9,trans-11 CLA, trans-9,cis-11 CLA, and trans-10,cis-12 CLA concentrations at pasture. The extent of changes in the relative distribution and abundance of CLA and CLnA isomers in milk fat were related to the nature (rapeseed or linseed) and form of oilseed (extruded, cold-pressed fat-rich meal or whole unprocessed) supplement and their interactions with the composition of the basal diet (conserved grass or pasture and dietary starch content). Furthermore, milk fat CLA and CLnA responses to treatments were repeatable between both outdoor periods. Variations in milk fat content and yield measured during the entire study were significantly and inversely associated with milk trans-10 18:1, trans-10,cis-12 CLA, and in particular, trans-9,cis-11 CLA concentrations.

Abstract
  AIM: In order to investigate which types of localized prostate cancer can be treated most effectively by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), cases of no residual cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens (pT0) after neoadjuvant ADT were analyzed.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy after neoadjuvant ADT were investigated retrospectively.

  RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (24.2%) were diagnosed with pT0 disease by pathological evaluation. The positive-core proportion of prostate biopsy was lower, the duration of neoadjuvant ADT was longer, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir before radical prostatectomy was lower in pT0 cases compared to non-pT0 cases, and these differences were statistically significant. The percentage of pT0 cases with PSA nadir <0.2 ng/ml and <0.008 ng/ml before radical prostatectomy were 29.2% (21 out of 72 cases) and 83.3% (5 out of 6 cases), respectively. The positive-core proportion of prostate biopsy and PSA nadir before radical prostatectomy had a significant impact on pT0 status after neoadjuvant ADT.

  CONCLUSION: ADT for localized prostate cancer is thought to be highly effective in cases with low cancer volume. ADT is effective in cases of localized prostate cancer with PSA below the levels of detection by supersensitive PSA assay, and such cases show no cancer recurrence. Treatment options in such cases include intermittent or discontinuation of ADT.

Abstract
  Several anticancer agents exert their cancer cell killing effects by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, a combination of ROS-producing agents and the inhibition of ROS elimination promotes the death of cancer cells. The sensitive to apoptosis gene (SAG) protein, a redox-inducible protein and potential ROS scavenger, protects mammalian cells from redox agent-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we found that silencing of SAG expression in human prostate cancer PC3 cells by transfection with SAG small-interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly enhanced susceptibility to doxorubicin- and to staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, pre-treatment with the thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine suppressed increases in ROS and apoptosis. This study suggests that knockdown of SAG augments the apoptosis of PC3 cells exposed to doxorubicin or staurosporine presumably by increasing intracellular ROS levels.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/AIM: To investigate periostin (POSTN) expression in the LNCaP cell line.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our LNCaP strain did not constitutively express the POSTN gene. Through cell transfection with a cloning vector, we developed an LNCaP cell line that stably expressed POSTN. LNCaP wild-type and transfected cells were incubated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the presence/or absence of bicalutamide (BIC). POSTN mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and growth was measured with the MTT assay.

  RESULTS: POSTN transfection stimulated LNCaP cell growth. While POSTN transfection did not interfere with the stimulatory effect of DHT, BIC had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. However, exposure to either DHT and/or BIC was not able to interfere with POSTN expression per se.

  CONCLUSION: We confirmed the role of POSTN in promoting cancer cell growth. Although POSTN transcription is not likely to be androgen-dependent, the fact that increased cell proliferation POSTN-mediated was impaired by BIC suggests an androgen modulation of POSTN interaction proteins.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms might be involved in inactivation of procarcinogens that contribute to the genesis and progression of cancers. However, studies investigating the association between GSTM1, GSTT1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and prostate cancer (PCa) risk report conflicting results, therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to re-examine the controversy.

  METHODS: Published literature from PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched (updated to June 2, 2012). According to our inclusion criteria, studies that observed the association between GSTM1, GSTT1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and PCa risk were included. The principal outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of PCa associated with GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms.

  RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies involving 11313 cases and 12934 controls were recruited. The overall OR, which was 1.2854 (95% CI=1.1405-1.4487), revealed a significant risk of PCa and GSTM1 null genotype, and the similar results were observed when stratified by ethnicity and control source. Further, the more important is that the present study first reported the high risks of PCa for people who with dual null genotype of GSTM1 and GSTT1 (OR=1.4353, 95% CI=1.0345-1.9913), or who with GSTT1 null genotype and GSTP1 A131G polymorphism (OR=1.7335, 95% CI=1.1067-2.7152). But no association was determined between GSTT1 null genotype (OR=1.102, 95% CI=0.9596-1.2655) or GSTP1 A131G polymorphism (OR=1.0845, 95% CI=0.96-1.2251) and the PCa risk.

  CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggested that the people with GSTM1 null genotype, with dual null genotype of GSTM1 and GSTT1, or with GSTT1 null genotype and GSTP1 A131G polymorphism are associated with high risks of PCa, but no association was found between GSTT1 null genotype or GSTP1 A131G polymorphism and the risk of PCa. Further rigorous analytical studies are highly expected to confirm our conclusions and assess gene-environment interactions with PCa risk.

Abstract
  This focus article introduces the concept of NutriChip, an integrated microfluidic platform for investigating the potential of the immuno-modulatory function of dairy food. The core component of the NutriChip is a miniaturized artificial human gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which consists of a confluent layer of epithelial cells separated from a co-culture of immune cells by a permeable membrane. This setting creates conditions mimicking the human GIT and allows studying processes that characterize the passage of nutrients though the human GIT, including the activation of immune cells in response to the transfer of nutrients across the epithelial layer. The NutriChip project started by developing a biologically active in vitro cellular system in a commercial Transwell co-culture system. This Transwell system serves as a reference for the micro-scale device which is being developed. The microfluidic setup of NutriChip allows monitoring of the response of immune cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as lipid polysaccharide (LPS), and to the application of potentially anti-inflammatory dairy food. This differential response will be quantified by measuring the variation in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), secreted by the immune cells, and this is achieved by using a dedicated optical imager. A series of dairy products will be screened for their anti-inflammatory properties using the NutriChip system and, finally, the outcome of the NutriChip will be validated by a human nutrition trial. Therefore, the NutriChip platform offers a new option to evaluate the influence of food quality on health, by monitoring the expression of relevant immune cell biomarkers.

Abstract
  Activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is a key step in the development of prostate cancer (PCa). Several mechanisms have been identified in AR activation, among them signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Disruption of STAT3 activity has been associated to cancer progression. Recent studies suggest that heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) may play a key role in PCa that may be independent of its catalytic function. We sought to explore whether HO-1 operates on AR transcriptional activity through the STAT3 axis. Our results display that HO-1 induction in PCa cells represses AR activation by decreasing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter activity and mRNA levels. Strikingly, this is the first report to show by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that HO-1 associates to gene promoters, revealing a novel function for HO-1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, HO-1 and STAT3 directly interact as determined by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Forced expression of HO-1 increases STAT3 cytoplasmic retention. When PCa cells were transfected with a constitutively active STAT3 mutant, PSA and STAT3 downstream target genes were abrogated under hemin treatment. Additionally, a significant decrease in pSTAT3 protein levels was detected in the nuclear fraction of these cells. Confocal microscopy images exhibit a decreased rate of AR/STAT3 nuclear co-localization under hemin treatment. In vivo studies confirmed that STAT3 nuclear delimitation was significantly decreased in PC3 tumors overexpressing HO-1 grown as xenografts in nude mice. These results provide a novel function for HO-1 down-modulating AR transcriptional activity in PCa, interfering with STAT3 signaling, evidencing its role beyond heme degradation.

Abstract
  Better understanding of the distinct and redundant functions of the proprotein convertase (PC) enzyme family within pathophysiological states has a great importance for potential therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the functional redundancy of PCs in prostate cancer in the commonly used androgen-sensitive LNCaP and the androgen-independent DU145 human cell lines. Using a lentiviral-based shRNA delivery system, we examined in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation characteristics of knockdown cell lines for the endogenous PCs furin, PACE4, and PC7 in both cell lines. Of the three PCs, only PACE4 was essential to maintain a high-proliferative status, as determined in vitro using XTT proliferation assays and in vivo using tumor xenografts in nude mice. Furin knockdowns in both cell lines had no effects on cell proliferation or tumor xenograft growth. Paradoxically, PC7 knockdowns reduced in vitro cellular proliferation but had no effect in vivo. Because PCs act within secretion pathways, we showed that conditioned media derived from PACE4 knockdown cells had very poor cell growth-stimulating effects in vitro. Immunohistochemistry of PACE4 knockdown tumors revealed reduced Ki67 and higher p27(KIP) levels (proliferation and cell cycle arrest markers, respectively). Interestingly, we determined that the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway was activated in PC7 knockdown tumors only, providing some explanations of the paradoxical effects of PC7 silencing in prostate cancer cell lines. We conclude that PACE4 has a distinct role in maintaining proliferation and tumor progression in prostate cancer and this positions PACE4 as a relevant therapeutic target for this disease.

Abstract
  To estimate the oxidative stress in patients with prostate cancer and in a control group, we used the biomarker of lipid peroxidation-isoprostanes (8-isoPGF(2)) and the level of selected antioxidants (glucose and uric acid [UA]). The level of urinary isoprostanes was determined in patients and controls using an immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. The levels of UA and glucose were also determined in serum by the use of UA Assay Kit and Glucose Assay Kit. We observed a statistically increased the level of isoprostanes in urine of patients with prostate cancer in compared with a control group. The concentration of tested antioxidants in blood from patients with prostate cancer was also higher than in healthy subjects. Moreover, our experiments indicate that the correlation between the increased amount of UA and the lipid peroxidation exists in prostate cancer patients (in all tested groups). Prostate cancer risk by urinary isoprostanes level was analyzed, and a positive association was found (relative risk for highest vs. lowest quartile of urinary isoprostanes = 1.6; 95 % confidence interval 1.2-2.4; p for trend = 0.03). We suggest that reactive oxygen species induce peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acid in patients with prostate cancer, and the level of isoprostanes may be used as a non-invasive marker for determination of oxidative stress. We also propose that UA may enhance the oxidative stress in patients with prostate cancer.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Breast milk is a major route of infant HIV infection, yet the majority of breast-fed, HIV-exposed infants escape infection by unknown mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the role of HIV-specific breast milk cells in preventing infant HIV infection.

  DESIGN: A prospective study was designed to measure associations between maternal breast milk HIV-specific interferon- (IFN-) responses and infant HIV-1 detection at 1 month of age.

  METHODS: In a Kenyan cohort of HIV-infected mothers, blood and breast milk HIV-gag IFN- ELISpot responses were measured. Logistic regression was used to measure associations between breast milk IFN- responses and infant HIV infection at 1 month of age.

  RESULTS: IFN- responses were detected in breast milk from 117 of 170 (69%) women. IFN- responses were associated with breast milk viral load, levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1, MIP-1, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted and stromal-cell derived factor 1 and subclinical mastitis. Univariate factors associated with infant HIV infection at 1 month postpartum included both detection and breadth of breast milk IFN- response (P = 0.08, P = 0.04, respectively), breast milk MIP-1 detection (P = 0.05), and plasma (P = 0.004) and breast milk (P = 0.004) viral load. In multivariate analyses adjusting for breast milk viral load and MIP-1, breast milk IFN- responses were associated with an approximately 70% reduction in infant HIV infection [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.092-0.91], and each additional peptide pool targeted was associated with an approximately 35% reduction in infant HIV (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.97).

  CONCLUSION: These data show breast milk HIV-gag-specific IFN- cellular immune responses are prevalent and may contribute to protection from early HIV transmission. More broadly, these data suggest breast milk cellular responses are potentially influential in decreasing mother-to-child transmission of viruses.

Abstract
  During tumor progression, EphA2 receptor can gain ligand-independent pro-oncogenic functions due to Akt activation and reduced ephrin-A ligand engagement. The effects can be reversed by ligand stimulation, which triggers the intrinsic tumor suppressive signaling pathways of EphA2 including inhibition of PI3/Akt and Ras/ERK pathways. These observations argue for development of small molecule agonists for EphA2 as potential tumor intervention agents. Through virtual screening and cell-based assays, we report here the identification and characterization of doxazosin as a novel small molecule agonist for EphA2 and EphA4, but not for other Eph receptors tested. NMR studies revealed extensive contacts of doxazosin with EphA2/A4, recapitulating both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions recently found in the EphA2/ephrin-A1 complex. Clinically used as an 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Cardura) for treating hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia, doxazosin activated EphA2 independent of 1-adrenoreceptor. Similar to ephrin-A1, doxazosin inhibited Akt and ERK kinase activities in an EphA2-dependent manner. Treatment with doxazosin triggered EphA2 receptor internalization, and suppressed haptotactic and chemotactic migration of prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma cells. Moreover, in an orthotopic xenograft model, doxazosin reduced distal metastasis of human prostate cancer cells and prolonged survival in recipient mice. To our knowledge, doxazosin is the first small molecule agonist of a receptor tyrosine kinase that is capable of inhibiting malignant behaviors in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of treatment using various systemic radiotherapies for metastatic skeletal involvement in patients with breast or prostate cancer.

  MATERIAL AND METHODS: The case histories of 350 patients treated at the Department of Radiation Medicine in 2006 to 2010 for multiple metastatic skeletal involvement in cancers at various sites were analyzed. The efficiency of treatment for pain syndrome and the magnitude of a myelosuppressive effect were estimated in the use of various systemic radiotherapies. For this, the authors compared: 1) two patient groups treated by 89Sr chloride monotherapy in the standard activity of 150 MBq or by that in combination with teleradiotherapy (TRT); 2) two patient groups treated by the monotherapy in the standard activity of 150 MBq or by 89Sr chloride fractional injection.

  RESULTS: The efficiency of treatment using various systemic radiotherapies was estimated. That was comparatively evaluated in the patient groups having various treatments. Algorithms of indications were elaborated to choose a systemic radiotherapy option depending on the clinical situation. An 89Sr chloride injection procedure was developed for patients with significant myelosuppression.

  CONCLUSION: 1. Various systemic radiotherapies as second-line therapy may be used to treat metastatic skeletal involvement in patients with cancer at various sites. 2. The most pronounced analgesic effect was found when 89Sr chloride in the standard activity of 150 MBq had been injected in combination with TRT (a 36% reduction in the intensity of pain syndrome); a less pronounced effect was produced by 89Sr chloride monotherapy (27%). The lowest analgesic effect was observed when 89Sr chloride had been fractionally injected (14%). 3. The levels of white blood cells and platelets were decreased in all the groups. 4. 89Sr chloride fractional injection is the method of choice when its single administration is impossible in patients with evident leukocyto- and thrombocytopenia.

Abstract
  G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their ligands have been implicated in progression and metastasis of several cancers. GPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins, and among the different types of G proteins, GNA12/13 have been most closely linked to tumor progression. In this study, we explored the role of GNA13 in prostate cancer cell invasion and the mechanism of up-regulation of GNA13 in these cells. An initial screen for GNA13 protein expression showed that GNA13 is highly expressed in the most aggressive cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GNA13 in highly invasive PC3 cells revealed that these cells depend on GNA13 expression for their invasion, migration, and Rho activation. As mRNA levels in these cells did not correlate with protein levels, we assessed the potential involvement of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in post-transcriptional control of GNA13 expression. Expression analysis of miRNAs predicted to bind the 3'-UTR of GNA13 revealed that miR-182 and miR-141/200a showed an inverse correlation to the protein expression in LnCAP and PC3 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in PC3 cells significantly reduced protein levels, GNA13-3'-UTR reporter activity and in vitro invasion of these cells. This effect was blocked by restoration of GNA13 expression in these cells. Importantly, inhibition of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in LnCAP cells using specific miRNA inhibitors elevated the expression of GNA13 and enhanced invasion of these cells. These data provide strong evidence that GNA13 is an important mediator of prostate cancer cell invasion, and that miR-182 and miR-200 family members regulate its expression post-transcriptionally.

Abstract
  The stromal reaction surrounding tumors leads to the formation of a tumor-specific microenvironment, which may play either a restrictive role or a supportive role in the growth and progression of the tumors. Lumican, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) of the extracellular matrix (ECM), regulates collagen fibrillogenesis. Recently, lumican has also been shown to regulate cell behavior during embryonic development, tissue repair and tumor progression. The role of lumican in cancer varies according to the type of tumor. In this study we analyze the role of lumican in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer both in vivo and in vitro. Overall lumican up-regulation was observed in the primary tumors analyzed through both real-time PCR and immunostaining. The increase in lumican expression was observed in the reactive stroma surrounding prostate primary tumors with fibrotic deposition surrounding the acinar glands. In vitro analysis demonstrated that lumican inhibited both the migration and invasion of metastatic prostate cancer cells isolated from lymph node, bone and brain. Moreover, prostate cancer cells seeded on lumican presented a decrease in the formation of cellular projections, lamellipodia detected by a decreased rearrangement in ZO-1, keratin 8/18, integrin 1 and MT1-MMP, and invadopodia detected by disruption of -smooth muscle actin, cortactin and N-WASP. Moreover, a significant increase in prostate cancer cell invasion was observed through the peritoneum of lumican knockout mice, further demonstrating the restrictive role lumican present in the ECM has on prostate cancer invasion. In conclusion, lumican present in the reactive stroma surrounding prostate primary tumors plays a restrictive role on cancer progression, and we therefore postulate that lumican could be a valuable marker in prostate cancer staging.

Abstract
  The antiproliferation effects of pipernonaline, a piperine derivative, were investigated on human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. It inhibited growth of androgen independent PC-3 and androgen dependent LNCaP prostate cells in a dose-dependent (30-90 uM) and time-dependent (24-48 h) manner. The growth inhibition of PC-3 cells was associated with sub-G(1) and G(0)/G(1) accumulation, confirmed by the down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, which are correlated with G(1) phase of cell cycle. Pipernonaline up-regulated cleavage of procaspase-3/PARP, but did not change expression of proapoptotic bax and antiapoptotic bcl-2 proteins. Its caspase-3 activation was confirmed by the caspase-3 assay kit. In addition, pipernonaline caused the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase of intracellular Ca(2+), and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which these phenomena were reversed by N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger. The results suggest that pipernonaline exhibits apoptotic properties through ROS production, which causes disruption of mitochondrial function and Ca(2+) homeostasis and leads to its downstream events including activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in PC-3 cells. This is the first report of pipernonaline toward the anticancer activity of prostate cancer cells, which provides a role for candidate agent as well as the molecular basis for human prostate cancer.

Abstract
  The androgen receptor (AR) for the male hormone androgen plays an important role in regulation of cell survival or death depending on the nature of cellular context and extracellular stimuli. The pro-survival function of AR is mediated mainly by transcriptional regulation of its target genes. By contrast, the pro-death function of AR can be transcription-dependent or -independent, although the underlying mechanism of the latter is incompletely understood. Here we report that, in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, AR promotes UV-induced apoptosis through down-regulation of basal expression of p21 independently of its transcriptional activity. Down-regulation of basal p21 expression depends on AR N-terminal interacting protein PIRH2, an E3 ligase for proteasomal degradation of p53. Silencing of PIRH2 up-regulates p53, which in turn activates p21 transcription. Consistent with this, knockdown of PIRH2 suppresses UV-induced AR-dependent apoptosis. Our data suggest that AR primes androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis through the PIRH2-p53-p21 axis. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Activin, a member of the transforming growth factor- family, has been known to be a growth and differentiating factor. Despite its pluripotent effects, the roles of activin signaling in prostate cancer pathogenesis are still unclear. In this study, we established several cell lines that express a constitutive active form of activin type IB receptor (ActRIBCA) in human prostate cancer cells, ALVA41 (ALVA-ActRIBCA). There was no apparent change in the proliferation of ALVA-ActRIBCA cells in vitro; however, their migratory ability was significantly enhanced. In a xenograft model, histological analysis revealed that the expression of Snail, a cell-adhesion-suppressing transcription factor, was dramatically increased in ALVA-ActRIBCA tumors, indicating epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Finally, mice bearing ALVA-ActRIBCA cells developed multiple lymph node metastases. In this study, we demonstrated that ActRIBCA signaling can promote cell migration in prostate cancer cells via a network of signaling molecules that work together to trigger the process of EMT, and thereby aid in the aggressiveness and progression of prostate cancers.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The accuracy of genomic prediction is highly dependent on the size of the reference population. For small populations, including information from other populations could improve this accuracy. The usual strategy is to pool data from different populations; however, this has not proven as successful as hoped for with distantly related breeds. BayesRS is a novel approach to share information across populations for genomic predictions. The approach allows information to be captured even where the phase of SNP alleles and casuative mutation alleles are reversed across populations, or the actual casuative mutation is different between the populations but affects the same gene. Proportions of a four-distribution mixture for SNP effects in segments of fixed size along the genome are derived from one population and set as location specific prior proportions of distributions of SNP effects for the target population. The model was tested using dairy cattle populations of different breeds: 540 Australian Jersey bulls, 2297 Australian Holstein bulls and 5214 Nordic Holstein bulls. The traits studied were protein-, fat- and milk yield. Genotypic data was Illumina 777K SNPs, real or imputed.

  RESULTS: Results showed an increase in accuracy of up to 3.5% for the Jersey population when using BayesRS with a prior derived from Australian Holstein compared to a model without location specific priors. The increase in accuracy was however lower than was achieved when reference populations were combined to estimate SNP effects, except in the case of fat yield. The small size of the Jersey validation set meant that these improvements in accuracy were not significant using a Hotelling-Williams t-test at the 5% level. An increase in accuracy of 1-2% for all traits was observed in the Australian Holstein population when using a prior derived from the Nordic Holstein population compared to using no prior information. These improvements were significant (P<0.05) using the Hotelling Williams t-test for protein- and fat yield.

  CONCLUSION: For some traits the method might be advantageous compared to pooling of reference data for distantly related populations, but further investigation is needed to confirm the results. For closely related populations the method does not perform better than pooling reference data. However, it does give an increased accuracy compared to analysis based on only one reference population, without an increased computational burden. The approach described here provides a general setup for inclusion of location specific priors: the approach could be used to include biological information in genomic predictions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: S. aureus is one of the main pathogens responsible for the intra-mammary infection in dairy ruminants. Although much work has been carried out to understand the complex physiological and cellular events that occur in the mammary gland in response to S. aureus, the protective mechanisms are still poorly understood. The objectives of the present study were to investigate gene expression during the early response of the goat mammary gland to an experimental challenge with S. aureus, in order to better understand the local and systemic response and to compare them in two divergent lines of goat selected for high and low milk somatic cell scores.

  RESULTS: No differences in gene expression were found between high and low SCS (Somatic Cells Score) selection lines. Analysing the two groups together, an expression of 300 genes were found to change from T0 before infection, and T4 at 24 hours and T5 at 30 hours following challenge. In blood derived white blood cells 8 genes showed increased expression between T0 and T5 and 1 gene has reduced expression. The genes showing the greatest increase in expression following challenge (5.65 to 3.16 fold change) play an important role in (i) immune and inflammatory response (NFKB1, TNFAIP6, BASP1, IRF1, PLEK, BATF3); (ii) the regulation of innate resistance to pathogens (PTX3); and (iii) the regulation of cell metabolism (CYTH4, SLC2A6, ARG2). The genes with reduced expression (-1.5 to -2.5 fold) included genes involved in (i) lipid metabolism (ABCG2, FASN), (ii) chemokine, cytokine and intracellular signalling (SPPI), and (iii) cell cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (KRT19).

  CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of genes with differential expression following infection showed an inverse relationship between immune response and lipid metabolism in the early response of the mammary gland to the S. aureus challenge. PTX3 showed a large change in expression in both milk and blood, and is therefore a candidate for further studies on immune response associated with mastitis.

Abstract
  The cofortification of milk with iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) is a strategy used to prevent these deficiencies during childhood. Given that Zn can negatively interact with iron in aqueous solutions, the objective of the present study was to determine the effect of Zn on Fe absorption of milk fortified with Fe and Zn. Twenty-eight women between 33 and 47 years of age, with contraception and a negative pregnancy test, participated in one of two absorption studies. They received on four different days, after an overnight fast, 200 mL of milk (26 % fat) fortified with 10 mg Fe/L, as (A) ferrous sulfate, or the same milk but with graded doses of added Zn, as Zn sulfate of (B) 5, (C) 10, and (D) 20 mg/L (study 1, n=15). In study 2 (n=13), subjects received the same milk formulations, but these were also fortified with ascorbic acid (70 mg/L). Milk was labeled with radioisotopes 59Fe or 55Fe, and the absorption of iron was measured by erythrocyte incorporation of radioactive Fe. The geometric mean and range of +/-1 SD of Fe absorption in study 1 were as follows: formula A=6.0 % (2.8-13.0 %); B=6.7 % (3.3-13.6 %); C=5.4 % (2.2-13.2 %); and D=5.2 % (2.8-10.0 %) (ANOVA for repeated measures, not significant). For study 2, data are as follows: 8.2 % (3.6-18.7 %); B=6.4 % (2.5-16.4 %); C=7.7 % (3.2-18.9 %); and D=5.2 (1.8-14.8 %) (ANOVA for repeated measures, not significant). In conclusion, according to the results from this study, it appears that the addition of zinc up to 20 mg/L does not significantly inhibit iron absorption from milk fortified with 10 mg/L of iron.

Abstract
  A case of mantle cell lymphoma involving the prostate is reported. This was associated with scattered histiocytes and features of granulomatous prostatitis. This demonstrates that histiocytes are seen in mantle cell lymphoma in unusual sites and raises the possibility of a pathogenetic association with granulomatous prostatitis.

Abstract
  The contextual signals that regulate the expansion of prostate tumor progenitor cells are poorly defined. We found that a significant fraction of advanced human prostate cancers and castration-resistant metastases express high levels of the 4 integrin, which binds to laminin-5. Targeted deletion of the signaling domain of 4 inhibited prostate tumor growth and progression in response to loss of p53 and Rb function in a mouse model of prostate cancer (PB-TAg mice). Additionally, it suppressed Pten loss-driven prostate tumorigenesis in tissue recombination experiments. We traced this defect back to an inability of signaling-defective 4 to sustain self-renewal of putative cancer stem cells in vitro and proliferation of transit-amplifying cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies indicated that mutant 4 fails to promote transactivation of ErbB2 and c-Met in prostate tumor progenitor cells and human cancer cell lines. Pharmacological inhibition of ErbB2 and c-Met reduced the ability of prostate tumor progenitor cells to undergo self-renewal in vitro. Finally, we found that 4 is often coexpressed with c-Met and ErbB2 in human prostate cancers and that combined pharmacological inhibition of these receptor tyrosine kinases exerts antitumor activity in a mouse xenograft model. These findings indicate that the 4 integrin promotes prostate tumorigenesis by amplifying ErbB2 and c-Met signaling in tumor progenitor cells.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer patients have increased levels of stress and anxiety. Conversely, men who take beta blockers, which interfere with signaling from the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, have a lower incidence of prostate cancer; however, the mechanisms underlying stress-prostate cancer interactions are unknown. Here, we report that stress promotes prostate carcinogenesis in mice in an adrenaline-dependent manner. Behavioral stress inhibited apoptosis and delayed prostate tumor involution both in phosphatase and tensin homolog-deficient (PTEN-deficient) prostate cancer xenografts treated with PI3K inhibitor and in prostate tumors of mice with prostate-restricted expression of c-MYC (Hi-Myc mice) subjected to androgen ablation therapy with bicalutamide. Additionally, stress accelerated prostate cancer development in Hi-Myc mice. The effects of stress were prevented by treatment with the selective 2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) antagonist ICI118,551 or by inducible expression of PKA inhibitor (PKI) or of BCL2-associated death promoter (BAD) with a mutated PKA phosphorylation site (BADS112A) in xenograft tumors. Effects of stress were also blocked in Hi-Myc mice expressing phosphorylation-deficient BAD (BAD3SA). These results demonstrate interactions between prostate tumors and the psychosocial environment mediated by activation of an adrenaline/ADRB2/PKA/BAD antiapoptotic signaling pathway. Our findings could be used to identify prostate cancer patients who could benefit from stress reduction or from pharmacological inhibition of stress-induced signaling.

Abstract
  Milk fat globule-EGF 8 (MFGE8) plays important, nonredundant roles in several biological processes, including apoptotic cell clearance, angiogenesis, and adaptive immunity. Several recent studies have reported a potential role for MFGE8 in regulation of the innate immune response; however, the precise mechanisms underlying this role are poorly understood. Here, we show that MFGE8 is an endogenous inhibitor of inflammasome-induced IL-1 production. MFGE8 inhibited necrotic cell-induced and ATP-dependent IL-1 production by macrophages through mediation of integrin (3) and P2X7 receptor interactions in primed cells. Itgb3 deficiency in macrophages abrogated the inhibitory effect of MFGE8 on ATP-induced IL-1 production. In a setting of postischemic cerebral injury in mice, MFGE8 deficiency was associated with enhanced IL-1 production and larger infarct size; the latter was abolished after treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist. MFGE8 supplementation significantly dampened caspase-1 activation and IL-1 production and reduced infarct size in wild-type mice, but did not limit cerebral necrosis in Il1b-, Itgb3-, or P2rx7-deficient animals. In conclusion, we demonstrated that MFGE8 regulates innate immunity through inhibition of inflammasome-induced IL-1 production.

Abstract
  Concurrent activation of RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways is implicated in prostate cancer progression. The negative regulators of these pathways, including sprouty2 (SPRY2), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), are commonly inactivated in prostate cancer. The molecular basis of cooperation between these genetic alterations is unknown. Here, we show that SPRY2 deficiency alone triggers activation of AKT and ERK, but this is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis. In addition to AKT and ERK activation, SPRY2 loss also activates a PP2A-dependent tumor suppressor checkpoint. Mechanistically, the PP2A-mediated growth arrest depends on GSK3 and is ultimately mediated by nuclear PTEN. In murine prostate cancer models, Pten haploinsufficiency synergized with Spry2 deficiency to drive tumorigenesis, including metastasis. Together, these results show that loss of Pten cooperates with Spry2 deficiency by bypassing a novel tumor suppressor checkpoint. Furthermore, loss of SPRY2 expression correlates strongly with loss of PTEN and/or PP2A subunits in human prostate cancer. This underlines the cooperation between SPRY2 deficiency and PTEN or PP2A inactivation in promoting tumorigenesis. Overall, we propose SPRY2, PTEN, and PP2A status as an important determinant of prostate cancer progression. Characterization of this trio may facilitate patient stratification for targeted therapies and chemopreventive interventions.

Abstract
  Fusion of the androgen receptor-regulated (AR-regulated) TMPRSS2 gene with ERG in prostate cancer (PCa) causes androgen-stimulated overexpression of ERG, an ETS transcription factor, but critical downstream effectors of ERG-mediating PCa development remain to be established. Expression of the SOX9 transcription factor correlated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in 3 independent PCa cohorts, and ERG-dependent expression of SOX9 was confirmed by RNAi in the fusion-positive VCaP cell line. SOX9 has been shown to mediate ductal morphogenesis in fetal prostate and maintain stem/progenitor cell pools in multiple adult tissues, and has also been linked to PCa and other cancers. SOX9 overexpression resulted in neoplasia in murine prostate and stimulated tumor invasion, similarly to ERG. Moreover, SOX9 depletion in VCaP cells markedly impaired invasion and growth in vitro and in vivo, establishing SOX9 as a critical downstream effector of ERG. Finally, we found that ERG regulated SOX9 indirectly by opening a cryptic AR-regulated enhancer in the SOX9 gene. Together, these results demonstrate that ERG redirects AR to a set of genes including SOX9 that are not normally androgen stimulated, and identify SOX9 as a critical downstream effector of ERG in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive PCa.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The present study reports the presence of several carotenoids and flavonoids in human milk samples.

  METHODS: Samples were collected from 17 women who delivered healthy term babies (>= 37 wk of gestation) at 1-, 4-, and 13-wk postpartum intervals.

  RESULTS: Epicatechin (63.7-828.5 nmol/L), epicatechin gallate (55.7-645.6 nmol/L), epigallocatechin gallate (215.1-2364.7 nmol/L), naringenin (64.1-722.0 nmol/L), kaempferol (7.8-71.4 nmol/L), hesperetin (74.8-1603.1 nmol/L), and quercetin (32.5-108.6 nmol/L) were present in human milk samples with high inter-/intraindividual variability. With the exception of kaempferol, the mean flavonoid content in human milk was not statistically different among lactation stages. In contrast, carotenoids -carotene (59.0-23.2 nmol/L), -carotene (164.3-88.0 nmol/L), -cryptoxanthin (30.6-13.5 nmol/L), -cryptoxanthin (57.4-24.8 nmol/L), zeaxanthin (46.3-21.4 nmol/L), lutein (121.2-56.4 nmol/L), and lycopene (119.9-49.5 nmol/L) significantly decreased from weeks 1 to 13 of lactation.

  CONCLUSION: The observed differences in the relative concentrations of the two phytochemical classes in human milk may be a result of several factors, including dietary exposure, stability in the milk matrix, efficiency of absorption/metabolism, and transfer from plasma to human milk. These data support the notion that flavonoids, as with carotenoids, are dietary phytochemicals present in human milk and potentially available to breast-fed infants. Copyright  2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidemiological studies suggest that regular consumption of cocoa-containing products may confer cardiovascular protection, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, studies on the effects of cocoa on different cardiovascular risk factors are still scarce. The aim of this study was too evaluate the effects of chronic cocoa consumption on lipid profile, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) particles and plasma antioxidant vitamin concentrations in high-risk patients.

  METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-two high-risk volunteers (19 men and 23 women, mean age 69.7+/-11.5 years) were included in a randomized, crossover feeding trial. All received 40g of cocoa powder with 500mL of skimmed milk/day(C+M) or only 500mL/day of skimmed milk (M) for 4 weeks in a random order. Before and after each intervention period, plasma lipids, oxLDL and antioxidant vitamin concentrations were measured, as well as urinary cocoa polyphenols metabolites derived from phase II and microbial metabolisms. Compared to M, C+M intervention increases HDLc [2.67mg/dL (95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.58-4.73; P=0.008)] and decreases oxLDL levels [-12.3U/L (CI,-19.3 to -5.2;P=0.001)]. No changes between intervention groups were observed in vitamins B1, B6, B12, C and E, or folic acid concentrations. In addition, subjects who showed higher increments in urinary cocoa polyphenol metabolites exhibited significant increases in HDLc and significant decreases in oxLDL levels (P<0.05; all).

  CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of cocoa power with milk modulates the lipid profile in high-risk subjects for CHD. In addition, the relationship observed between the urinary excretion of cocoa polyphenol metabolites and plasma HDLc and oxLDL levels suggests a beneficial role for cocoa polyphenols in lipid metabolism.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the significance of docetaxel-based chemotherapy in elderly Japanese men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 159 consecutive patients aged>=75 years with mCRPC who were treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The efficacy and tolerability of this therapy were retrospectively analyzed.

  RESULTS: In these 159 patients, the median age and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before docetaxel-based chemotherapy were 78 years and 44.0 ng/ml, respectively. Of these patients, 42 (26.4%) and 117 (73.6%) received docetaxel as a weekly (30 mg/m2) and 3-weekly (70 mg/m2) regimen, respectively, and estramustine was administered combining with docetaxel in 77 (48.4%). Following docetaxel-based chemotherapy, PSA declined in 118 patients (74.3%), including 87 (54.6%) achieving a PSA decline>=50%, and the median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 2.9 and 23.2 months, respectively. Of several factors examined, univariate analysis identified performance status (PS), significant clinical pain, bone metastasis, schedule of treatment, treatment cycle, and PSA response as significant predictors of OS, of which only PS, treatment cycle, and PSA response appeared to be independently associated with OS on multivariate analysis. The major grade 3-4 toxicities were myelosuppression, including neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in 78 (49.1%), 22 (13.8%), and 14 (8.8%), respectively.

  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that docetaxel-based chemotherapy is clinically feasible in Japanese men aged>=75 years with mCRPC considering the cancer control as well as safety associated with this therapy.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine whether the measurement of tissue mRNA levels of AMACR and survivin has a role in distinguishing prostate cancer (PCa) from benign lesions and high risk from low-risk PCa in men with suspected PCa.

  METHODS: TRUS prostate biopsies from 170 patients with suspected PCa were used to measure the mRNA levels of AMACR and survivin using semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique. The diagnosis, staging and risk stratification of PCa was based on established clinical criteria. The ability of tissue mRNA levels to distinguish benign from malignant prostate and high- and low-risk PCa was assessed. The diagnostic value for the two genes was evaluated by calculating their individual and combined sensitivity and specificity, which were compared with that of PSA.

  RESULTS: Histological examination showed 90/170 (53%) of patients had benign prostate pathology, while 80/170 (47%) had PCa. Tissue mRNA levels of both AMACR and survivin were able to distinguish benign from PCa biopsies (p<0.0001) and also high-risk from low-risk PCa cases (p<0.02, p<0.05, respectively). Compared with serum PSA levels, the combined use of tissue mRNA levels of AMACR and survivin yielded a higher detection specificity (84 vs. 22%).

  CONCLUSION: Based on AMACR and survivin combined sensitivity and specificity, these mRNA markers can be used as an adjunct to distinguish patients with and without PCa and in men with PCa may help to identify those with low- or high-risk PCa.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine blood and tissue levels of nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and their correlations with well-known prognostic indicators [total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), %free/total PSA (%f/t PSA), pathological stage (pT), and Gleason sum] in patients who had radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for localized prostate cancer (PCa) without metastasis.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Preoperatively 31 patients' bloods were obtained for determination of NO, MDA, fPSA, tPSA, and %f/tPSA ratios. Tissues were obtained from RRP specimens for determination of NO and MDA. Gleason sum was assigned for each patient, and pT was determined according to 2002 TNM staging system. pTs were as follows: 10 pT2a, 7 pT2b, 8 pT2c, 4 pT3a, and 2 pT3b. Gleason sum of the PCa in the RRP specimens was as follows: 5 in 1, 6 in 14, 7 in 14, and 9 in 2 patients.

  RESULTS: There were strong correlations between blood and tissue levels of NO (r=0.83, p<0.001) and MDA (r=0.63, p<0.001), between serum NO and plasma MDA (r=0.88, p<0.001), and finally between tissue NO and tissue MDA (r=0.83, p<0.001). There was also a significant (p<0.05) relationship between all well-known prognostic indicators of PCa (tPSA, %f/tPSA, Gleason sum, and pT) and blood and tissue NO and MDA levels, with single exception of correlation between tissue MDA and Gleason sum (p=0.073).

  CONCLUSION: Clinically appropriate correlations shown in this study indicates that NO and MDA may be used for prognostic assessment of localized PCa, especially if supported with other well-designed studies including higher number of patients through multi-institutional collaboration.

Abstract
  Chronic inflammation leads to the formation of a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment that can promote tumor development, growth and differentiation through augmentation of tumor angiogenesis. Prostate cancer (CaP) risk and prognosis are adversely correlated with a number of inflammatory and angiogenic mediators, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NF-kB and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) was recently identified as an endogenous ligand for TLR4 that is secreted from CaP cells and promotes inflammation. Inhibition of Prx1 by CaP cells resulted in reduced expression of VEGF, diminished tumor vasculature and retarded tumor growth. The mechanism by which Prx1 regulates VEGF expression in normoxic conditions was investigated in the current study. Our results show that incubation of mouse vascular endothelial cells with recombinant Prx1 caused increases in VEGF expression that was dependent upon TLR4 and required hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) interaction with the VEGF promoter. The induction of VEGF was also dependent upon NF-kB; however, NF-kB interaction with the VEGF promoter was not required for Prx1 induction of VEGF suggesting that NF-kB was acting indirectly to induce VEGF expression. The results presented here show that Prx1 stimulation increased NF-kB interaction with the HIF-1 promoter, leading to enhanced promoter activity and increases in HIF-1 mRNA levels, as well as augmented HIF-1 activity that resulted in VEGF expression. Prx1 induced HIF-1 also promoted NF-kB activity, suggesting the presence of a positive feedback loop that has the potential to perpetuate Prx1 induction of angiogenesis. Strikingly, inhibition of Prx1 expression in CaP was accompanied with reduced expression of HIF-1. The combined findings of the current study and our previous study suggest that Prx1 interaction with TLR4 promotes CaP growth potentially through chronic activation of tumor angiogenesis.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of vocal symptoms and parameters in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two male patients aged 60-83 years were recruited for this study. The subjects were divided into two groups: one group consisted of 18 patients with prostate cancer treated with ADT using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and the other group consisted of 14 controls matched according to age. Demographic data included age, history of smoking, reflux, and duration of therapy. The reported phonatory symptoms were hoarseness, inability to project the voice, and vocal fatigue. Patients also underwent acoustic analysis, and the following acoustic variables were measured: fundamental frequency, relative average perturbation, shimmer, noise-to-harmonic ratio, and voice turbulence index.

  RESULTS: Compared with the control group, there was no statistical difference in any of the phonatory symptoms. The habitual pitch was significantly higher in the prostate cancer group compared with the controls (131.76 vs 114.11 Hz), with a P value of 0.021. There was also a significant increase in all the perturbation parameters, namely, relative average perturbation and shimmer, with a significant difference with respect to the latter (P value=0.014). There was also a significant increase in the noise-to-harmonic ratio (P value=0.014).

  CONCLUSION: The administration of ADT for patients with prostate cancer can affect the habitual pitch. However, there are no noticeable vocal changes reported by the patients. Copyright  2012 The Voice Foundation. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The G84E mutation in the HOXB13 gene has been associated with a high lifetime risk of prostate cancer in North America (about 20-fold). The geographical and ethnic extent of this recurrent allele has not yet been determined.

  METHODS: We assayed for the presence of the G84E mutation in 3,515 prostate cancer patients and 2,604 controls from Poland and estimated the odds ratio for prostate cancer associated with the allele.

  RESULTS: The G84E mutation was detected in 3 of 2,604 (0.1%) individuals from the general population in Poland and in 20 of 3,515 (0.6%) men with prostate cancer (Odds ratio [OR]=5.0; 95% CI: 1.5-16.7; P=0.008). The allele was present in 4 of 416 (1.0%) men with familial prostate cancer (OR=8.4, 95% CI: 1.9-37.7; P=0.005).

  CONCLUSIONS: The G84E mutation predisposes to prostate cancer in Poland, but accounts for only a small proportion of cases. We expect that the G84E founder mutation might be present in other Slavic populations. Copyright  2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the capacity of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) to modulate the recruitment and the differentiation of monocytes/macrophages both in vitro and in human prostate.

  METHODS: Using Boyden chambers, we assessed PEDF effect on the migration of monocytes and chemically activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Normal, prostatitis, and prostate cancer specimens were retrospectively selected and examined by immunohistochemistry for PEDF expression and infiltration of immune CD68+macrophagic cells. PEDF expression and macrophage density were then correlated with each other and clinicopathological parameters. M1 and M2 differentiation markers were quantified by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA.

  RESULTS: In chemotaxis, PEDF induced the migration of monocytes/macrophages. In immunohistochemistry, macrophages were markedly increased in prostatitis and malignant compared to normal tissues. PEDF was expressed at variable levels in the stroma and epithelium. PEDF mRNA was down-regulated in both prostate cancer and prostatitis compared to normal tissues. In correlation studies, macrophage density and PEDF expression were respectively positively and negatively associated with prostate size. Most importantly, PEDF expression positively correlated with macrophage density. Finally, PEDF stimulated the expression of iNOS, IL12, and TNF; and inhibited IL10 and arginase 1 in mouse and human macrophages confirming a M1-type differentiation.

  CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that PEDF acts directly on monocytes/macrophages by inducing their migration and differentiation into M1-type cells. These findings suggest a possible role of macrophages in PEDF anti-tumor properties and may support further development of PEDF-based anti-cancer therapy. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) is a main therapeutic target for treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). The natural compound isochaihulactone (K8), which has a chiral center ring and two racemic forms (E-K8 and Z-K8), has anti-tumor effects on multiple cancer types both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we determined which form of K8 contains significant tumor cytotoxicity and examined how this form regulates AR expression in PCa cells and xenografts.

  METHODS: We chose the androgen-dependent human PCa cell line LNCaP and the androgen-independent cell lines DU145 and PC-3 to study the anti-tumor potency and AR regulation mediated by Z-K8. We measured cell viability and used flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. Growth inhibition in vivo was evaluated with an LNCaP xenograft animal model.

  RESULTS: In LNCaP cells, Z-K8 significantly repressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, repressed AR mRNA and protein expression in a time-dependent manner, and induced JNK phosphorylation. Furthermore, treatment with a JNK inhibitor significantly abolished Z-K8-induced AR downregulation. Z-K8 did not significantly inhibit reporter gene expression of constructs containing the AR promoter when it contained a mutated Sp1 binding site. Z-K8 also showed anti-tumor effects in the xenograft animal model.

  CONCLUSION: Z-K8 not only induced LNCaP apoptosis but also reduced AR expression. These results indicate that Z-K8 may be a potential anti-tumor drug for PCa therapy. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Chromatin regulators ANCCA and EZH2 are overexpressed in prostate cancer and play crucial roles in androgen-stimulated and castration-refractory prostate tumor growth and survival. However, how their expression is regulated in the tumors and whether they play a role in prostate development remains unclear.

  METHODS: Prostate tissue from different developmental stages of mouse and human were examined by IHC, qRT-PCR and Western for expression of ANCCA, EZH2, and Ki-67. Animals were castrated and T-implanted for the expression response in normal prostate and tumors. siRNA knockdown and ChIP were performed for the mechanism of ANCCA regulation of EZH2.

  RESULTS: In contrast to their very low level expression in adult prostate, ANCCA and EZH2 are strongly expressed in the epithelium and mesenchyme of mouse and human UGS. Their expression becomes more restricted to epithelial cells during later development and displays a second peak during puberty, which correlates with the proliferative status of the epithelium. Importantly, their expression in normal prostate and tumors is strongly suppressed by castration and markedly induced by testosterone replacement. While androgen suppresses EZH2 in CRPC cells, in LNCaP cells, physiological concentrations of androgen stimulate expression of PRC2 genes (EZH2, SUZ12, and EED), which is mediated by androgen-induced ANCCA and involves E2F and histone H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 complex.

  CONCLUSION: EZH2 and ANCCA are androgen regulated and strongly expressed in early prostate morphogenesis and during puberty, suggesting their important role in prostate development. Regulation of EZH2 by ANCCA emphasizes bromodomain protein ANCCA as a potential therapeutic target against prostate cancer. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Stromal-epithelial interactions are important in both development and prostate cancer. Stromal changes have been shown to be powerful prognostic indicators of prostate cancer progression and of patient death helping to define lethal versus indolent phenotypes. The specific molecular underpinnings of these interactions are incompletely understood. We investigated whether stromal cathepsin D (CathD) overexpression affects prostate tumorigenesis through a paracrine mechanism.

  METHODS: Normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF) were retrovirally transduced to overexpress cyclin D1 (CD1) and were designated NPF(CD1) . Cathepsin D expression was knocked down using shRNA in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) and NPF(CD1) . We analyzed these stromal cell lines using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and tissue recombination.

  RESULTS: An examination of human prostate tissue revealed significantly increased stromal staining of CathD in malignant prostate tissue. Overexpression of CD1 in normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF(CD1) ) produced a phenotype similar to, but more moderate than, CAF in a tissue recombination model. Knockdown studies revealed that CathD is required for NPF(CD1) motility and invasive growth in vitro. BPH-1 cell proliferation was found to be induced when cultured with NPF(CD1) conditioned medium, this effect was inhibited when CathD was knocked down in NPF(CD1) cells. Overexpression of CathD in prostate stromal cells induced malignancy in adjacent epithelium, and this transformation was inhibited when stromal CathD expression was knocked down in CAF.

  CONCLUSIONS: The study presented here demonstrates increased CathD expression is seen in human CAF. The upregulation of CD1 results in concomitant increases in CathD expression. Elevated CathD expression in the stroma contributes to tumor promotion. Copyright  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  Prostatic stromal sarcoma is a fairly rare tumor that constitutes approximately 0.1-0.2% of all prostatic cancers. Detailed characteristics of the tumor are still unclear due to its rarity.We describe a case of prostatic stromal sarcoma in a 63 year-old man who suffered from urinary obstructive symptoms. Palliative transuterine resection was performed and the preliminary histopathological diagnosis was neuroendocrine carcinoma. After chemotherapy, total pelvic exenteration was performed. Histopathologically, the tumor was composed of monotonously proliferating small to medium-sized round cells, which existed in compact islands with loose or dense fibrovascular networks. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were widely positive for vimentin, CD56, CD99 and focally positive for synaptophysin, CD10, progesterone receptor, desmin and CD34, but negative for EMA, cytokeratin, estrogen receptor, S-100 and myoglobin. Most of the previously reported tumors exhibited positive stainability for CD10 and progesterone receptor. In addition to these markers, expressions of CD56, CD99 and synaptophysin were characteristically detected in our case. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case of prostatic stromal sarcoma with characteristic immunohistochemical staining properties. Although the biological characteristics of this rare tumor have not yet been elucidated, these findings suggest prostatic stromal sarcoma can potentially show neuroectodermal differentiation.

Abstract
  AIM: Accumulating data suggest that neuropeptides produced by neuroendocrine cells play a crucial role in the progression and aggressiveness of hormone refractory prostate cancer (CaP). In this study, we have investigated the presence and function of the neuropeptide 26RFa in CaP.

  METHODS: We have localised and quantified tumour cells containing 26RFa and its receptor, GPR103, in CaP sections of various grades. In vitro experiments were performed to investigate the effects of 26RFa on the migration, proliferation and neuroendocrine differentiation of the androgeno-independent (AI) prostate cancer cell line DU145.

  RESULTS: 26RFa and GPR103 are present in carcinomatous foci exhibiting a neuroendocrine differentiation, and the number of 26RFa and GPR103-immunoreactive cancer cells increases with the grade of CaP. 26RFa stimulated the migration of native or transdifferentiated AI DU145 cells, but had no effect on their proliferation. Furthermore, 26RFa induced the neuroendocrine differentiation of DU145 cells as assessed by the occurrence of neurite-like extensions and the increase of the expression of the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin A.

  CONCLUSION: The present data indicate that 26RFa may participate to the development of CaP at the AI state by promoting the neuroendocrine differentiation and the migration of cancer cells via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: In vitro irradiated blood samples from prostate cancer patients showing late normal tissue damage were examined for lymphocyte response by measuring chromosomal aberrations and proliferation rate.

  METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were selected from a randomized trial evaluating the optimal timing of dose-escalated radiation and short-course androgen deprivation therapy. Of 438 patients, 3% experienced grade 3 late radiation proctitis and were considered to be radiosensitive. Blood samples were taken from 10 of these patients along with 20 matched samples from patients with grade 0 proctitis. The samples were irradiated at 6 Gy and, along with control samples, were analyzed for dicentric chromosomes and excess fragments per cell. Cells in first and second metaphase were also enumerated to determine the lymphocyte proliferation rate.

  RESULTS: At 6 Gy, there were statistically significant differences between the radiosensitive and control cohorts for 3 endpoints: the mean number of dicentric chromosomes per cell (3.26 +/- 0.31, 2.91 +/- 0.32; P=.0258), the mean number of excess fragments per cell (2.27 +/- 0.23, 1.43 +/- 0.37; P<.0001), and the proportion of cells in second metaphase (0.27 +/- 0.10, 0.46 +/- 0.09; P=.0007).

  CONCLUSIONS: These results may be a valuable indicator for identifying radiosensitive patients and for tailoring radiation therapy. Crown Copyright  2013. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  There is an ever-increasing global demand from consumers for high-quality foods with major emphasis placed on quality and safety attributes. One of the main demands that consumers display is for minimally processed, high-nutrition/low-energy natural foods with no or minimal chemical preservatives. The nutritional value of raspberry fruit is widely recognized. In particular, red raspberries are known to demonstrate a strong antioxidant capacity that might prove beneficial to human health by preventing free radical-induced oxidative stress. However, food products that are consumed raw, are increasingly being recognized as important vehicles for transmission of human pathogens. Food irradiation is one of the few technologies that address both food quality and safety by virtue of its ability to control spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms without significantly affecting sensory or other organoleptic attributes of the food. Food irradiation is well established as a physical, nonthermal treatment (cold pasteurization) that processes foods at or nearly at ambient temperature in the final packaging, reducing the possibility of cross contamination until the food is actually used by the consumer. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of gamma radiation on raspberries in order to assess consequences of irradiation. Freshly packed raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.) were irradiated in a (60)Co source at several doses (0.5, 1, or 1.5 kGy). Bioburden, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, physicochemical properties such as texture, color, pH, soluble solids content, and acidity, and sensorial parameters were assessed before and after irradiation and during storage time up to 14 d at 4C. Characterization of raspberries microbiota showed an average bioburden value of 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/g and a diverse microbial population predominantly composed of two morphological types (gram-negative, oxidase-negative rods, 35%, and filamentous fungi, 41%). The inactivation studies on the raspberries mesophilic population indicated a one log reduction of microbial load (95% inactivation efficiency for 1.5 kGy), in the surviving population mainly constituted by filamentous fungi (79-98%). The total phenolic content of raspberries indicated an increase with radiation doses and a decrease with storage time. The same trend was found for raspberries' antioxidant capacity with storage time. Regarding raspberries physicochemical properties, irradiation induced a significant decrease in firmness compared with nonirradiated fruit. However, nonirradiated and irradiated fruit presented similar physicochemical and sensory properties during storage time. Further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of irradiation as a raspberries treatment process.

Abstract
  It has been suggested that the use of nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) can lead to weight gain, but evidence regarding their real effect in body weight and satiety is still inconclusive. Using a rat model, the present study compares the effect of saccharin and aspartame to sucrose in body weight gain and in caloric intake. Twenty-nine male Wistar rats received plain yogurt sweetened with 20% sucrose, 0.3% sodium saccharin or 0.4% aspartame, in addition to chow and water ad libitum, while physical activity was restrained. Measurements of cumulative body weight gain, total caloric intake, caloric intake of chow and caloric intake of sweetened yogurt were performed weekly for 12 weeks. Results showed that addition of either saccharin or aspartame to yogurt resulted in increased weight gain compared to addition of sucrose, however total caloric intake was similar among groups. In conclusion, greater weight gain was promoted by the use of saccharin or aspartame, compared with sucrose, and this weight gain was unrelated to caloric intake. We speculate that a decrease in energy expenditure or increase in fluid retention might be involved. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  To determine the impact of prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating growth factor (G-CSF) on the risk of febrile neutropenia in a cohort of patients enrolled at the University Federico II of Naples and treated with cabazitaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We carried out a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of patients enrolled at our institution in a compassionate-use programme with cabazitaxel, aimed at providing early access to the drug before its commercial availability in mCRPC patients. Besides baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, data on treatment efficacy and toxicity, as well as those on the use of G-CSF per patient per cycle were extracted. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Fisher's exact test was used to explore a relationship between a single event of grade 3 or more neutropenia or febrile neutropenia and previous use of G-CSF. Univariate analysis was carried out to evaluate predictors of grade 3 or more neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia. Of 34 patients enrolled at our institution from December 2010 to December 2011, 32 had received at least one dose of cabazitaxel and were included in the analysis. Patients received a median of 10 cabazitaxel cycles. Grade 3 or more neutropenia was common, occurring in 64.5% of patients. Three patients (9.3%) developed febrile neutropenia. Twenty-seven patients received prophylaxis with G-CSF during at least one cycle using peg-filgrastim. The risk of grade 3 or more neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia per patient and per cycle was seven times lower when G-CSF was used. Baseline neutrophil count of less than 4570/mm was the strongest predictor of grade 3 or more neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia. No toxic death was reported. Only one patient discontinued cabazitaxel because of an adverse event. Our analysis suggests that prophylaxis with peg-filgrastim may considerably reduce the incidence of grade 3 or more neutropenia and, possibly, of febrile neutropenia in mCRPC patients treated with cabazitaxel. Further analyses involving a larger population are warranted to confirm our results.

Abstract
  A general phenomenon in peripartum mammals is the breakdown of (acquired) immunity. The incidence of parasite load, disease and inflammation often rise during the specific energetically demanding time of pregnancy and lactation. In this period, blood leukocytes display decreased DNA synthesis in response to mitogens in vitro. Leukocyte activation, the phase of the cell cycle preceding the DNA synthetic phase has hardly been investigated, but the few studies suggest that leukocyte activation may also be impaired by the limited energy/nutrient availability. Leukocyte activation is characterized by manifold processes, thus, we used the cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as a measure of ATP turnover to support all these processes. We hypothesized that the activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) - in terms of oxygen consumed over basal levels after in vitro stimulation - is altered by energy balance around parturition. We studied peripartum high-yielding dairy cows because they undergo substantial fluctuations in energy intake, energy output and body fat mass. We established a fluorescence-based test strategy allowing for long-term (>=24h) quantification of O(2)-consumption and studied the peripartum period from 5 weeks ante partum to 5 weeks postpartum. In addition, we determined cellular lactate production, DNA/RNA synthesis and cell size and zoo-technical parameters such as animal energy intake and milk yield were assessed, as well as selected plasma parameters, e.g. glucose concentration. The basal OCR of PBMC from pregnant, non-lactating cows (n=6, -5 weeks ante partum) was 1.19+/-0.15 nmol min(-1) (10(7)cells)(-1) and increased to maximum levels of 2.54+/-0.49 nmol min(-1) (10(7)cells)(-1) in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBMC. The basal OCR did not change over the peripartum period. Whereas the activation indices, herein defined as the PHA-induced 24h-increase of OCR above baseline, amounted to 1.1+/-0.3, 4.2+/-0.3, 4.1+/-1.1, 2.1+/-0.3, and 2.7+/-0.5 at weeks -5, -1, +1, +2, and +5 relative to parturition, respectively. Because the activation index was positively correlated to plasma glucose levels and to energy balance during late pregnancy (week -5/week -1) and transition to lactation (week -1/week +2), we conclude that PBMC activation is modulated by energy/nutrient availability. In future studies, the activation index should aid the identification of causal mechanisms of disparity in PBMC activation, such as attenuated ion transport or macromolecule synthesis.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones may influence risk of cancer through their role in cell differentiation, growth, and metabolism. One study of circulating thyroid hormones supports this hypothesis with respect to prostate cancer. We undertook a prospective analysis of thyroid hormones and prostate cancer risk in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study.

  METHODS: Within the ATBC Study, a randomized controlled trial of -tocopherol and -carotene supplements and cancer incidence in male smokers, 402 prostate cancer cases were sampled. Controls were matched 2:1 to cases on age and date of blood collection. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of prostate cancer were estimated for quintiles of serum total and free thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and by categories of thyroid status.

  RESULTS: Men with serum higher TSH had a decreased risk of prostate cancer compared to men with lower TSH (Q5 vs. Q1-4: OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51-0.97, p = 0.03). When the T4 and TSH measurements were combined to define men as hypothyroid, euthyroid or hyperthyroid, hypothyroid men had a lower risk of prostate cancer compared to euthyroid men (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.28-0.81, p = 0.006). We observed no association between hyperthyroid status and risk, although the number of hyperthyroid men with prostate cancer was small (n = 9).

  CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of smokers, men with elevated TSH and those classified as being in a hypothyroid state were at decreased risk of prostate cancer. Future studies should examine the association in other populations, particularly non-smokers and other racial/ethnic groups.

Abstract
  Maintaining the health of farm animals forms the basis for a sustainable and profitable production of food from animal origin. Recently, the effects of carotenoids on the oxidative status as well as on reproductive and immune functions in cattle have been demonstrated. The present study aimed at investigating dermal carotenoid levels in cattle recovering from abomasal displacement. For this purpose, serial in vivo measurements were undertaken using a miniaturized scanner system that relies on reflection spectroscopy (Opsolution GmbH, Kassel, Germany). In a first trial, repeated measurements of dermal carotenoid concentrations were performed on the udder skin of healthy non-lactating cattle (n = 6) for one month in weekly intervals. In a second trial, in vivo dermal carotenoid concentrations were determined in intervals in 23 cows following surgical treatment of abomasal displacement. The results show that dermal carotenoid concentrations, determined on a weekly basis over a period of one month, showed variations of up to 18% in the healthy individuals kept under constant conditions with respect to housing and nutrition. Repeated measurements during the recovery period following surgical treatment of abomasal displacement resulted in an increase in dermal carotenoid concentrations in 18 of 20 animals with a favourable outcome when compared with results obtained within 12 hours following surgery. The mean increase in dermal carotenoid concentrations in subsequent measurements was 53 +/- 44%, whereas levels decreased (mean 31 +/- 27%) in cattle with a fatal outcome.These results indicate potential applications for reflection spectroscopy for non-invasive early detection of changes in the dermal carotenoid concentrations as a reflection of the antioxidant status in an animal.

Abstract
  The type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) are a family of cell surface proteolytic enzymes contributing to a number of processes, such as tumour invasion and metastasis. Within the TTSPs, matriptase-2 is a relatively newly identified member and this protease has been shown to play a key role in cancer progression. -catenin has long been regarded as an oncogene. The deregulation of the -catenin signalling pathway plays a significant role in the progression and possibly the development of cancer. However, little is known about the role of matriptase-2 in prostate cancer. This study aimed to examine the correlation between matriptase-2 and -catenin. Matriptase-2 was knocked down in the normal prostate cells, PZHPV7 and PNT2C2, using a ribozyme transgene targeting matriptase-2. The altered cells were used in a number of invitro experiments designed to investigate the involvement of matriptase-2 with -catenin and to further characterise its function. The knockdown of matriptase-2 had no effect on cell growth or adhesion but significantly reduced cell motility (PZHPV7 cells, p<0.001; PNT2C2 cells, p=0.001 vs. respective control cells) and invasive capability (PZHPV7 cells, p=0.001; PNT2C2 cells, p=0.007). The knockdown also caused a large increase in -catenin protein expression at the cell membrane in PZHPV7 and PNT2C2 cells and a decrease in PC3 cells overexpressing matriptase-2, but did not affect the mRNA levels. Matriptase-2 may have an important impact on prostate cancer progression. The data gained from this study suggest that matriptase-2 protects against the development and progression of prostate cancer by regulating the motility and invasive capabilities of prostate cancer cells. Matriptase-2 also reduces the levels of -catenin at the cell membrane. As -catenin is highly involved in the regulation of cellular processes, including motility and invasion, the reduction of -catenin expression by matriptase-2 may be a possible mechanism by which matriptase-2 functions.

Abstract
  The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential roles of the SH3-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SGEF) in human prostate cancer. Experimental data showed that SGEF was overexpressed in human prostate cancer cells and specimens. The reduction of SGEF expression through an SGEF-targeting siRNA in androgen-independent C4-2 and C4-2B cells suppressed both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist bicalutamide further strengthened this inhibitory effect due to the suppression of the elevated AR transactivation after knockdown of SGEF. Collectively, our results provide the first demonstration that SGEF is a novel promoter of human prostate cancer progression and development.

Abstract
  Cell-free circulating DNA in plasma and serum may serve as a biomarker for malignant tumor detection and follow up in patients with a variety of solid tumors including prostate cancer. In healthy patients, DNA is normally released from an apoptotic source which generates small fragments of cell-free DNA, whereas cancer patients have cell-free circulating DNA that originated from necrosis, autophagy, or mitotic catastrophe. Cell-free circulating DNA levels were measured by a quantitative real-time PCR method with a set of primers targeted to amplify the consensus ALU apoptotic versus necrotic origin. Prostate cancer patients before and 3 months after diagnosis showed cell-free circulating DNA released at apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, all patients after 6 months demonstrated DNA released at non-apoptotic cell. The principal source of cell-free circulating DNA is of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death. However, during treatment, this feature could change. Therefore, the study of cell-free circulating DNA would be important to follow the evolution of the disease during the treatment.

Abstract
  Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) is an important regulator of cell signaling because of its ability to dephosphorylate receptors of growth factors as well as the cytokines and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with these receptors. In the current study, we used four different prostate cancer cell lines: PC3, DU145, LNCaP and LNCaP-IL6+. Tumor specimens from 122 patients with prostate cancer were analyzed using a tissue microarray. Our data demonstrate that all four prostate cancer cell lines express the SHP-2 protein. Additionally, low staining intensity and SHP-2 expression in the cytoplasm of cancer cells in prostate tumor specimens was inversely correlated with prostate volume (p = 0.041 and p = 0.042, respectively) whereas nuclear staining was positively correlated with extracapsular extension (p = 0.039). In our post-prostatectomy specimens, we found that patients with low SHP-2 expression had less favorable outcomes with respect to biochemical recurrence and clinical progression (p = 0.005 and p = 0.018, respectively). The loss of cytoplasmic SHP-2 expression is associated with increased growth and prostatic cancer progression.

Abstract
  Computationally identifying effective biomarkers for cancers from gene expression profiles is an important and challenging task. The challenge lies in the complicated pathogenesis of cancers that often involve the dysfunction of many genes and regulatory interactions. Thus, sophisticated classification model is in pressing need. In this study, we proposed an efficient approach, called ellipsoidFN (ellipsoid Feature Net), to model the disease complexity by ellipsoids and seek a set of heterogeneous biomarkers. Our approach achieves a non-linear classification scheme for the mixed samples by the ellipsoid concept, and at the same time uses a linear programming framework to efficiently select biomarkers from high-dimensional space. ellipsoidFN reduces the redundancy and improves the complementariness between the identified biomarkers, thus significantly enhancing the distinctiveness between cancers and normal samples, and even between cancer types. Numerical evaluation on real prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukemia gene expression datasets suggested that ellipsoidFN outperforms the state-of-the-art biomarker identification methods, and it can serve as a useful tool for cancer biomarker identification in the future.

Abstract
  Telomerase is activated in the majority of invasive breast cancers, but the time point of telomerase activation during mammary carcinogenesis is not clear. We have recently presented a transgenic mouse model to study human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene expression in vivo (hTERTp-lacZ). In the present study, hTERTp-lacZxWAP-T bitransgenic mice were generated to analyze the mechanisms responsible for human and mouse TERT upregulation during tumor progression in vivo. We found that telomerase activity and TERT expression were consistently upregulated in SV40-induced invasive mammary tumors compared to normal and hyperplastic tissues and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Human and mouse TERT genes are regulated similarly in the breast tissue, involving the CEBP transcription factors. Loss of CEBP- and induction of CEBP- expression correlated well with the activation of TERT expression in mouse mammary tumors. Transfection of CEBP- into human or murine cells resulted in TERT repression, whereas knockdown of CEBP- in primary human mammary epithelial cells resulted in reactivation of endogenous TERT expression and telomerase activity. Conversely, ectopic expression of CEBP- activated endogenous TERT gene expression. Moreover, ChIP and EMSA experiments revealed binding of CEBP- and CEBP- to human TERT-promoter. This is the first evidence indicating that CEBP- and CEBP- are involved in TERT gene regulation during carcinogenesis. Copyright  2012 UICC.

Abstract
  In dairy cows, the intensity of metabolic activity, associated with the negative energy balance (NEBAL), is responsible for an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, subsequently, for the development of the condition of oxidative stress, which may overwhelm the antioxidant potential of the bovine maternal organism, making it prone to the development of many puerperal dysfunctions, as well as to an alteration of colostrum and milk quality. Given these premises, the aims of this study are to evaluate serum and milk concentrations of ROS and lipoperoxides, vitamins A and E, on the 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th day postpartum of dairy cows, a particularly critical period during which the NEBAL reaches its nadir, and to compare the trends of these parameters in two different bovine breeds. The study was performed in pluriparous Italian Friesian and Brown dairy cows. On the 10th day postpartum, all cows underwent a clinical examination to exclude the presence of alterations; furthermore, on the same day, a milk sample was collected from each cow, in order to perform the somatic cell count (SCC; (CE) N. 853/2004) and to establish which of them had an SCC <=400,000/ml or >400,000/ml. In this study, among the 110 cows that were initially selected, the evaluation of these parameters allowed the inclusion of 80 animals, which were divided into four groups of 20 subjects each: Group F and F1: Italian Friesian healthy cows, with SCC <=400,000/ml and >400,000/ml, respectively; Group B and B1: Italian Brown healthy cows, with SCC <=400,000/ml and >400,000/ml, respectively. On the 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th day postpartum, peripheral blood and milk samples were collected. The results obtained show that in group B1 there were higher concentrations of ROS and milk antioxidants compared with Friesian group cows. This datum let us suppose that even in the presence of higher ROS concentrations the antioxidant status found in group B1 seems to be able to counteract the oxidative damage, which is more likely to develop in these cows.

Abstract
  Once daily milking (ODM) is a management practice that can improve working conditions and reduce production costs in dairy farming compared with twice daily milking (TDM). However, ODM is associated with a decrease in milk yield. Previous research indicated that disruption of tight junctions in the mammary gland may be one of the regulatory factors involved in the milk yield decrease observed during ODM. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of mammary epithelium disruption in the regulation of the activity and dynamics of mammary epithelial cells (MEC) during 5 weeks of ODM in goats. Twelve alpine goats (producing 3.67 +/- 0.64 kg/day and 47 +/- 1.6 days in milk) were assigned to two groups that were milked once or twice a day during 5 weeks and then switched back to TDM. Mammary biopsies were collected before and on days 2 and 16 of both ODM and TDM switchback periods. Milk purified epithelial cells were collected before and on days 1, 7, 21 and 28 during ODM as well on days 1 and 7 of the TDM switchback period. The mRNA levels of genes involved in the regulation of synthetic activity and apoptosis were analysed by RT-PCR in milk MEC and mammary biopsies. ODM decreased yields of milk (-23%), lactose (-23%) and casein (-16%). Lactose synthesis was regulated at the transcriptional level by downregulation of -lactalbumin mRNA levels in both biopsy samples (-30%) and milk MEC (-74%). TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling) staining of mammary gland biopsies did not show any increase in cell apoptosis after 2 and 16 days of ODM (0.8% and 1%, respectively) despite upregulation of Bax mRNA levels in milk MEC. This suggests that the decrease in milk yield observed during ODM is attributable to a decrease in synthetic activity rather than to induction of MEC cell death. ODM induced the disruption of tight junctions in the mammary gland only on the first day of the treatment as indicated by increased blood lactose concentration. This indicates that the decrease in MEC activity observed over the 5 weeks of ODM was not due to disruption of the mammary gland tight junctions. There was no carryover effect of 5 weeks of ODM on milk production. Therefore, it appears that the decrease in milk yield that occurs during ODM in goats is due to regulation of synthetic activity rather than to apoptosis of MEC.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Many prostate cancers demonstrate an increased expression of growth factor receptors such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) which have been correlated with increased resistance to radiotherapy and poor prognosis in other tumors. Therefore, response to radiation could potentially be improved by using inhibitors of these abnormally activated pathways. We have investigated the radiosensitizing effects of sunitinib, a potent, multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGFR and PDGFR receptors, on human prostate cancer cells.

  METHODS: The radiosensitizing effects of sunitinib were assessed on human prostate cancer cell lines DU145, PC3 and LNCaP by clonogenic assay. Sunitinib's ability to inhibit the activities of its key targets was determined by immunoblot analysis. The radiosensitizing effects of sunitinib in vivo were tested on human tumor xenografts growing in nude mice where response was assessed by tumor growth delay.

  RESULTS: Clonogenic survival curve assays for both DU145 and PC3 cells showed that the surviving fraction at 2 Gy was reduced from 0.70 and 0.52 in controls to 0.44 and 0.38, respectively, by a 24 hr pretreatment with 100 nM sunitinib. LNCaP cells were not radiosensitized by sunitinib. Dose dependent decreases in VEGFR and PDGFR activation were also observed following sunitinib in both DU145 and PC3 cells. We assessed the ability of sunitinib to radiosensitize PC3 xenograft tumors growing in the hind limb of nude mice. Sunitinib given concurrently with radiation did not prolong tumor growth delay. However, when animals were treated with sunitinib commencing the day after fractionated radiation was complete, tumor growth delay was enhanced compared to radiation alone.

  CONCLUSIONS: We conclude, based on the in vivo results, that sunitinib and radiation do not interact directly to radiosensitize the PC3 tumor cells in vivo as they did in vitro. The fact that tumor growth delay was enhanced when sunitinib was given after radiotherapy was completed suggests that sunitinib may be acting on the irradiated tumor stroma and suppressing its ability to sustain regrowth of the irradiated tumor. Based on these preclinical findings, we suggest that the combination of sunitinib and radiation for the treatment of prostate cancer deserves further development.

Abstract
  Increased dietary intake of Selenium (Se) has been suggested to lower prostate cancer mortality, but supplementation trials have produced conflicting results. Se is incorporated into 25 selenoproteins. The aim of this work was to assess whether risk of prostate cancer is affected by genetic variants in genes coding for selenoproteins, either alone or in combination with Se status. 248 cases and 492 controls from an EPIC-Heidelberg nested case-control study were subjected to two-stage genotyping with an initial screening phase in which 384 tagging-SNPs covering 72 Se-related genes were determined in 94 cases and 94 controls using the Illumina Goldengate methodology. This analysis was followed by a second phase in which genotyping for candidate SNPs identified in the first phase was carried out in the full study using Sequenom. Risk of high-grade or advanced stage prostate cancer was modified by interactions between serum markers of Se status and genotypes for rs9880056 in SELK, rs9605030 and rs9605031 in TXNRD2, and rs7310505 in TXNRD1. No significant effects of SNPs on prostate cancer risk were observed when grade or Se status was not taken into account. In conclusion, the risk of high-grade or advanced-stage prostate cancer is significantly altered by a combination of genotype for SNPs in selenoprotein genes and Se status. The findings contribute to explaining the biological effects of selenium intake and genetic factors in prostate cancer development and highlight potential roles of thioredoxin reductases and selenoprotein K in tumour progression.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In the present study, we have investigated the prognostic usefulness of phosphorylated Akt immunoreactivity (pAkt-IR) in prostate cancer using a well-characterised tissue microarray from men who had undergone transurethral resection due to lower urinary tract symptoms.

  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: pAkt-IR in prostate epithelial and tumour cells was assessed using a monoclonal anti-pAkt (Ser(473)) antibody. Immunoreactive intensity was determined for 282 (tumour) and 240 (non-malignant tissue) cases. Tumour pAkt-IR scores correlated with Gleason score, tumour Ki67-IR (a marker of cell proliferation) and tumour phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (pEGFR)-IR. For cases followed with expectancy, a high tumour pAkt-IR was associated with a poor disease-specific survival, and the prognostic information provided by this biomarker was additive to that provided by either (but not both) tumour pEFGR-IR or Ki67-IR. Upon division of the cases with respect to their Gleason scores, the prognostic value of pAkt-IR was seen for patients with Gleason score 8-10, but not for patients with Gleason score 6-7.

  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Tumour pAkt-IR is associated with both disease severity and disease-specific survival. However, its clinical use as a biomarker is limited, since it does not provide prognostic information in patients with Gleason scores 6-7.

Abstract
  Recently, we showed that the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 has a significant therapeutic potential in treating lymph node metastases of human PC-3 prostate carcinoma in tumor xenografts. In this study, underlying mechanisms of the virus-mediated metastases reduction were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that virus-treatment resulted in a drastically decrease of blood and lymph vessels, representing essential routes for PC-3 cell migration, in both tumors and metastases. Thus, GLV-1h68 drastically reduced essential routes for the metastatic spread of PC-3 cells. Furthermore, analysis of viral distribution in GLV-1h68-injected tumor-bearing mice by plaque assays, revealed significantly higher virus titers in metastases compared to solid tumors. To elucidate conditions potentially mediating the preferential viral colonization and eradication of metastases, microenvironmental components of uninfected tumors and metastases were compared by microscopic studies. These analyses revealed that PC-3 lymph node metastases showed increased vascular permeability, higher proliferation status of tumor cells as determined by BrdU- and Ki-67 assays and lesser necrosis of PC-3 cells than solid tumors. Moreover, an increased number of immune cells (MHCII(+)/CD68(+) macrophages, MHCII(+)/CD19(+) B lymphocytes) combined with an up-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in metastases in comparison to primary PC-3 tumors. We propose that these microenvironmental components mediated the metastatic tropism of GLV-1h68. Therefore, vaccinia virus-based oncolytic virotherapy might offer a novel treatment of metastatic prostate carcinomas in humans.

Abstract
  Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a hallmark of advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer, for which no successful therapy exists. NED tumour cells escape apoptotic cell death by alterations of Ca(2+) homeostasis where the store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is known to be a key event. We have previously shown that the downregulation of Orai1 protein representing the major molecular component of endogenous SOCE in human prostate cancer cells, and constituting the principal source of Ca(2+) influx used by the cell to trigger apoptosis, contributes to the establishment of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype (Cell Death Dis. 2010 Sep 16;1:e75.). Here, we report for the first time that the decrease of SOCE during NED may be caused by alternative NED-induced mechanism involving cytoskeleton reorganisation. NED induced by androgen deprivation resulted in a decrease of SOCE due to cortical F-actin over-polymerization which inhibits thapsigargin-induced SOCE. The disruption of F-actin polymerization by Cytochalasin D in NED cells restored SOCE, while the induction of F-actin polymerization by jasplakinolide or calyculin A diminished SOCE without changing the expression of key SOCE players: Orai1, STIM1, and TRPC1. Our data suggest that targeting cytoskeleton-induced pathways of malignant cells together with SOCE-involved channels may prove a useful strategy in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

Abstract
  The mechanisms responsible for the switch of prostate cancer from androgen-sensitive (AS) to androgen-insensitive (AI) form are not well understood. Regulation of androgen receptor (AR), through which androgens control the expression of genes involved in prostate cells proliferation, migration and death also involves its cross-talk with the other signaling pathways, transcription factors and coregulatory proteins, such as -catenin. With the aim to determine their possible contribution in triggering the switch from AS to AI form, which occurs upon androgen deprivation therapy - AR, Akt and -catenin expression were knocked-down with respective siRNAs. Treatment of LNCaP prostate cells with siRNA for AR significantly reduced their proliferation (45-70%), expression of nuclear - catenin, cyclin-D1, cyclin-G1, c-Myc as well as activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2,-7,-9 and cell migration. Surprisingly, after longer (over 72 hrs) silencing of AR in LNCaP cells, elevated levels of p-Akt were detected and enhanced proliferation as well as expression of nuclear -catenin, cyclin-D1, c-Myc and activity of MMPs were observed. Such effects were not observed in either PC-3 or DU145 AI cells. However, silencing of Akt and /or -catenin in those as well as in LNCaP cells led to their decreased proliferation and migration. Our findings suggest that in prostate cancer cells, either AR or Akt signaling prevails, depending on their initial androgen sensitivity and its availability. In AI prostate cancer cells, Akt takes over the role of AR and more effectively contributes through the same signaling molecule, -catenin, to AI cancer progression.

Abstract
  Prostate cancer is the product of dysregulated homeostasis within the aging prostate. Supplementation with selenium in the form of selenized yeast (Se-yeast) significantly reduced prostate cancer incidence in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial. Conversely, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed no such cancer-protective advantage using selenomethionine (SeMet). The possibility that SeMet and Se-yeast are not equipotent in promoting homeostasis and cancer risk reduction in the aging prostate has not been adequately investigated; no direct comparison has ever been reported in man or animals. Here, we analyzed data on prostatic responses to SeMet or Se-yeast from a controlled feeding trial of 49 elderly beagle dogs-the only non-human species to frequently develop prostate cancer during aging-randomized to one of five groups: control; low-dose SeMet, low-dose Se-yeast (3 ug/kg); high-dose SeMet, high-dose Se-yeast (6 ug/kg). After seven months of supplementation, we found no significant selenium form-dependent differences in toenail or intraprostatic selenium concentration. Next, we determined whether SeMet or Se-yeast acts with different potency on six markers of prostatic homeostasis that likely contribute to prostate cancer risk reduction-intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT), testosterone (T), DHT:T, and epithelial cell DNA damage, proliferation, and apoptosis. By analyzing dogs supplemented with SeMet or Se-yeast that achieved equivalent intraprostatic selenium concentration after supplementation, we showed no significant differences in potency of either selenium form on any of the six parameters over three different ranges of target tissue selenium concentration. Our findings, which represent the first direct comparison of SeMet and Se-yeast on a suite of readouts in the aging prostate that reflect flux through multiple gene networks, do not further support the notion that the null results of SELECT are attributable to differences in prostatic consequences achievable through daily supplementation with SeMet, rather than Se-yeast.

Abstract
  MicroRNAs are small, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play an important role in various biological processes. Although most microRNAs expression profiles studies have been performed in humans or rodents, relatively limited knowledge also exists in other mammalian species. The identification of the full repertoire of microRNAs expressed in the lactating mammary gland of Capra hircus would significantly increase our understanding of the physiology of lactating mammary glands. In this study, two libraries were constructed using the lactating mammary gland tissues of Laoshan dairy goats (Capra hircus) during peak and late lactation. Solexa high-throughput sequencing technique and bioinformatics were used to determine the abundance and differential expression of the microRNAs between peak and late lactation. As a result, 19,044,002 and 7,385,833 clean reads were obtained, respectively, and 1,113 conserved known microRNAs and 31 potential novel microRNA candidates were identified. A total of 697 conserved microRNAs were significantly differentially expressed with a P-value<0.01, 272 microRNAs were up-regulated and 425 microRNAs were down-regulated during peak lactation. The results were validated using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. 762,557 annotated mRNA transcripts were predicted as putative target gene candidates. The GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis suggested that differentially expressed microRNAs were involved in mammary gland physiology, including signal transduction, and cell-cell and cell-extracellular communications. This study provided the first global of the microRNA in Capra hircus and expanded the repertoire of microRNAs. Our results have great significance and value for the elucidation of complex regulatory networks between microRNAs and mRNAs and for the study of mammary gland physiology and lactation.

Abstract
  The process of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in biological membranes of cells is carried out by free radical mechanism, a feature of which is the interaction of radicals with other molecules. In this work we investigated the antioxidant activity of cationic whey protein isolate, obtained by the cation-exchange chromatography on KM-cellulose from raw cow's milk, in vitro and in vivo. In biological liquids, which are milk, blood serum, fetal fluids, contains a complex of biologically active substances with a unique multifunctional properties, and which are carrying out a protective, antimicrobial, regenerating, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, regulatory and others functions. Contents of the isolate were determined electrophoretically and by its biological activity. Cationic whey protein isolate included lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, pancreatic RNase, lysozyme and angeogenin. The given isolate significantly has an antioxidant effect in model experimental systems in vitro and therefore may be considered as a factor that can adjust the intensity of lipid oxidation. In model solutions products of lipid oxidation were obtained by oxidation of phosphatidylcholine by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a source of iron. The composition of the reaction mixture: 0,4 mM H2O2; 50 mcM of hemin; 2 mg/ml L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine from soybean (Sigma, German). Lipid peroxidation products were formed during the incubation of the reaction mixture for two hours at 37 degrees C. In our studies rats in the adaptation period immediately after isolation from the nest obtained from food given orally native cationic whey protein isolate at the concentration three times higher than in fresh cow's milk. On the manifestation of the antioxidant activity of cationic whey protein isolate in vivo evidence decrease of lipid peroxidation products concentration in the blood of rats from the experimental group receipt whey protein isolate in dos 0,6 mg/g for more than 20% (p<0,05) with oral feeding. Thus, significantly cationic whey protein isolate has an antioxidant effect in model experimental systems, and so can be considered as a factor that can regulate the intensity of lipid oxidation.

Abstract
  Distinguishing aggressive from indolent disease and developing effective therapy for advanced disease are the major challenges in prostate cancer research. Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS transcription factors, such as ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer. How they contribute to tumorigenesis and whether they play similar or distinct in vivo roles remain elusive. Here we show that in mice with ERG or ETV1 targeted to the endogenous Tmprss2 locus, either factor cooperated with loss of a single copy of Pten, leading to localized cancer, but only ETV1 appeared to support development of invasive adenocarcinoma under the background of full Pten loss. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ERG and ETV1 control a common transcriptional network but largely in an opposing fashion. In particular, while ERG negatively regulates the androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional program, ETV1 cooperates with AR signaling by favoring activation of the AR transcriptional program. Furthermore, we found that ETV1 expression, but not that of ERG, promotes autonomous testosterone production. Last, we confirmed the association of an ETV1 expression signature with aggressive disease and poorer outcome in patient data. The distinct biology of ETV1-associated prostate cancer suggests that this disease class may require new therapies directed to underlying programs controlled by ETV1.

Abstract
  Pulsed light (PL) treatment can effectively inactivate a large proportion of contaminating bacteria on surfaces and in clear solutions. An important issue that needs to be investigated is whether repeated exposure to PL treatment causes any changes to the growth and resistance behavior of the bacteria surviving the treatment. To test this, three challenge microorganisms were used: Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, and Escherichia coli. Cells of the challenge bacteria were treated with either low or high PL doses. Survivors of the PL treatment were enumerated, isolated, regrown, and exposed again to PL treatment. PL inactivation curves were generated for the survivors of each exposure cycle (as well as controls) to examine possible differences induced by repeated treatments. Growth curves of L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, and E. coli isolates recovered from exposure to either 1.1 or 10.1 J/cm(2) were not significantly different from the growth curves of untreated cells. Reduction levels of up to 4 and up to 6 log CFU were obtained after exposure to 1.1 and 10.1 J/cm(2), respectively, both for the controls and the repeatedly treated and recovered isolates. These results show that PL did not significantly change the growth kinetics or resistance to PL of the target microorganisms after up to 10 exposures. These findings have significance for the practical application of PL treatment, as they indicate that this technology does not select for microorganisms with increased resistance.

Abstract
  Many cancer therapeutics target DNA and exert cytotoxicity through the induction of DNA damage and inhibition of transcription. We report that a DNA minor groove binding hairpin pyrrole-imidazole (Py-Im) polyamide interferes with RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) activity in cell culture. Polyamide treatment activates p53 signaling in LNCaP prostate cancer cells without detectable DNA damage. Genome-wide mapping of RNAP2 binding shows reduction of occupancy, preferentially at transcription start sites, but occupancy at enhancer sites is unchanged. Polyamide treatment results in a time- and dose-dependent depletion of the RNAP2 large subunit RPB1 that is preventable with proteasome inhibition. This polyamide demonstrates antitumor activity in a prostate tumor xenograft model with limited host toxicity.

Abstract
  Epigenetic changes have been suggested to drive prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify novel epigenetics-related genes in PCa tissues, and to examine their expression in metastatic PCa cell lines. We analyzed the expression of epigenetics-related genes via a clustering analysis based on gene function in moderately and poorly differentiated PCa glands compared to normal glands of the peripheral zone (prostate proper) from PCa patients using Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays. Our analysis identified 12epigenetics-related genes with a more than 2-fold increase or decrease in expression and a p-value <0.01. In modera-tely differentiated tumors compared to normal glands of the peripheral zone, we found the genes, TDRD1, IGF2, DICER1, ADARB1, HILS1, GLMN and TRIM27, to be upregulated, whereas TNRC6A and DGCR8 were found to be downregulated. In poorly differentiated tumors, we found TDRD1, ADARB and RBM3 to be upregulated, whereas DGCR8, PIWIL2 and BC069781 were downregulated. Our analysis of the expression level for each gene in the metastatic androgen-sensitive VCaP and LNCaP, and -insensitive PC3 and DU-145 PCa cell lines revealed differences in expression among the cell lines which may reflect the different biological properties of each cell line, and the potential role of each gene at different metastatic sites. The novel epigenetics-related genes that we identified in primary PCa tissues may provide further insight into the role that epigenetic changes play in PCa. Moreover, some of the genes that we identified may play important roles in primary PCa and metastasis, in primary PCa only, or in metastasis only. Follow-up studies are required to investigate the functional role and the role that the expression of these genes play in the outcome and progression of PCa using tissue microarrays.

Abstract
  Sepia ink oligopeptide (SIO) is a tripeptide extracted from Sepia ink. To test the hypothesis that SIO inhibits prostate cancer by inducing apoptosis, the effects of SIO on the proliferation of three human prostate cancer cell lines were examined using a CCK-8 assay. SIO significantly inhibited the proliferation of DU-145, PC-3 and LNCaP cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry studies showed that exposing DU-145, PC-3 and LNCaP cells to 5, 10, or 15 mg/mL SIO for 24 h increased the percentage of the early-stage apoptotic cells from 11.84% to 38.26% (DU-145), 22.76% to 39.96% (PC-3) and 5.05% to 16.11% (LNCaP), respectively. In addition, typical morphologic changes were observed in the cells with acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. SIO treatment induced strong S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner in DU-145 and LNCaP. In contrast, SIO treatment induced strong Sub G1 and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner in PC-3. SIO exposure for 24 h decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased the expression of the apoptogenic protein Bax. Moreover, the Bax/Bcl-2expression ratio was increased. Concurrently, the expression of caspase-3 was upregulated. These data support our hypothesis that SIO has anticarcinogenic properties.

Abstract
  Carbazole substituted imines (2a-l) were prepared from N-methyl-3-amino carbazole with different aldehydes. The imines compounds undergo (2+2) cycloaddition reactions with in situ ketenes to produce -lactam compounds (3a-l). The -lactam compounds were tested as inhibitors of the xanthine oxidase (XO) purified from bovine milk. The results show that these compounds exhibit inhibitory effects on XO at low concentrations with IC(50) values ranging from 21.65 to 58.04 M. The most effective compound for XO was 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-3-phenylazetidin-2-one with IC(50) of 21.65 uM. The lactams investigated here showed effective XO inhibitory effects, in the same range as the clinically used allopurinol.

Abstract
  The spectrum of cancers seen in a hospital based Lynch syndrome registry of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers was examined to determine the distribution of cancers and examine excess cancer risk. Overall there were 504 cancers recorded in 368 mutation carriers from 176 families. These included 236 (46.8%) colorectal and 268 (53.2%) extracolonic cancers. MLH1 mutation carriers had a higher frequency of colorectal cancers whereas MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 mutation carriers had more extracolonic cancers although these differences were not statistically significant. Men had fewer extracolonic cancers than colorectal (45.3 vs. 54.7%), whereas women had more extracolonic than colorectal cancers (59.0 vs. 41.0%). The mean age at diagnosis overall for extracolonic cancers was older than for colorectal, 49.1 versus 44.8years (P<=0.001). As expected, the index cancer was colorectal in 58.1% of patients and among the extracolonic index cancers, endometrial was the most common (13.8%). A significant number of non-Lynch syndrome index cancers were recorded including breast (n=5) prostate (n=3), thyroid (n=3), cervix (n=3), melanoma (n=3), and 1 case each of thymoma, sinus cavity, and adenocarcinoma of the lung. However, standardized incidence ratios calculated to assess excess cancer risk showed that only those cancers known to be associated with Lynch syndrome were significant in our sample. We found that Lynch syndrome patients can often present with cancers that are not considered part of Lynch syndrome. This has clinical relevance both for diagnosis of Lynch syndrome and surveillance for cancers of different sites during follow-up of these patients.

Abstract
  Oncolytic adenoviruses have shown promising efficacy in clinical trials targeting prostate cancers that frequently develop resistance to all current therapies. The replication-selective mutants Ad and dl922-947, defective in pRb-binding, have been demonstrated to synergise with the current standard of care, mitoxantrone and docetaxel, in prostate cancer models. While expression of the early viral E1A gene is essential for the enhanced cell killing, the specific E1A-regions required for the effects are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that replicating mutants deleted in small E1A-domains, binding pRb (dl1108), p300/CBP (dl1104) and p400/TRRAP or p21 (dl1102) sensitize human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU145, 22Rv1) to mitoxantrone and docetaxel. Through generation of non-replicating mutants, we demonstrate that the small E1A12S protein is sufficient to potently sensitize all prostate cancer cells to the drugs even in the absence of viral replication and the E1A transactivating domain, conserved region (CR) 3. Furthermore, the p300/CBP-binding domain in E1ACR1 is essential for drug-sensitisation in the absence (AdE1A1104) but not in the presence of the E1ACR3 (dl1104) domain. AdE1A1104 also failed to increase apoptosis and accumulation of cells in G2/M. All E1ACR2 mutants (AdE1A1108, dl922-947) and AdE1A1102 or dl1102 enhance cell killing to the same degree as wild type virus. In PC-3 xenografts in vivo the dl1102 mutant significantly prolongs time to tumor progression that is further enhanced in combination with docetaxel. Neither dl1102 nor dl1104 replicates in normal human epithelial cells (NHBE). These findings suggest that additional E1A-deletions might be included when developing more potent replication-selective oncolytic viruses, such as the AdCR2-mutants, to further enhance potency through synergistic cell killing in combination with current chemotherapeutics.

Abstract
  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a commonly used cancer biomarker for prostate cancer, and is often included as part of routine physical examinations in China. Serum levels of PSA may be influenced by genetic factors as well as other factors. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in a European population successfully identified six genetic loci that were significantly associated with PSA level. In this study, we aimed to identify common genetic variants that are associated with serum level of PSA in a Chinese population. We also evaluated the effects of those variants by creating personalized PSA cutoff values. A two-stage GWAS of PSA level was performed among men age 20-69years and self-reported cancer-free participants that underwent routine physical examinations at several hospitals in Guangxi Province, China. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with PSA levels in the first stage of sample (N=1,999) were confirmed in the second stage of sample (N=1,496). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the independent contribution of confirmed SNPs and known covariates, such as age, to the level of PSA. SNPs in three regions were significantly associated with levels of PSA in this two-stage GWAS, and had combined P values between 4.62 x 10(-17) and 6.45 x 10(-37). The three regions are located on 1q32.1 at SLC45A3, 10q11.23 at MSMB, and 19q13.33 at KLK3. The region 1q32.1 at SLC45A3 was identified as a novel locus. Genetic variants contributed significantly more to the variance of PSA level than known covariates such as age. Personalized cutoff values of serum PSA, calculated based on the inheritance of these associated SNPs, differ considerably among individuals. Identification of these genetic markers provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of PSA. Taking individual variation into account, these genetic variants may improve the performance of PSA to predict prostate cancer.

Abstract
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are related to tumour progression, and high levels of ROS have been observed in prostate tumours compared to normal prostate. ROS can positively influence AKT signalling and thereby promote cell survival. The aim of this project was to establish whether the ROS generated in prostate cancer cells positively regulate AKT signalling and enable resistance to apoptotic stimuli. In PC3 cells, dual oxidase (DUOX) enzymes actively generate ROS, which inactivate phosphatases, thereby maintaining AKT phosphorylation. Inhibition of DUOX by diphenylene iodium (DPI), intracellular calcium chelation and small-interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in lower ROS levels, lower AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylation, as well as reduced cell viability and increased susceptibility to apoptosis stimulating fragment (FAS) induced apoptosis. This report shows that ROS levels in PC3 cells are constitutively maintained by DUOX enzymes, and these ROS positively regulate AKT signalling through inactivating phosphatases, leading to increased resistance to apoptosis.

Abstract
  In human milk zinc (Zn) is bound to proteins and low molecular mass (LMM) ligands. Numerous investigations demonstrated that Zn bioavailability in human milk is for infant much higher than in cow's milk. It was presumed that in the LMM human milk fraction highly bioavailable Zn-citrate prevails. However, literature data are controversial regarding the amount of Zn-citrate in human milk since analytical procedures reported were not quantitative. So, complex investigation was carried out to develop analytical method for quantitative determination of this biologically important molecule. Studies were performed within the pH range 5-7 by the use of synthetic solutions of Zn-citrate prepared in HEPES, MOPS and MES buffers. Zn-citrate was separated on weak anion-exchange convective interaction media (CIM) diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) monolithic chromatographic column using NH(4)NO(3) as an eluent. Separated Zn species were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Quantitative separation of Zn-citrate complexes ([Zn(Cit)](-) and [Zn(Cit)(2)](4-); column recoveries 94-102%) and good repeatability and reproducibility of results with relative standard deviation (RSD+/-3.0%) were obtained. In fractions under the chromatographic peaks Zn-binding ligand was identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS). Limits of detection (LOD) for determination of Zn-citrate species by CIM DEAE-FAAS and CIM DEAE-ICP-MS were 0.01 ug Zn mL(-1) and 0.0005 ug Zn mL(-1), respectively. Both techniques were sensitive enough for quantification of Zn-citrate in human milk. Results demonstrated that about 23% of total Zn was present in the LMM milk fraction and that LMM-Zn corresponded to Zn-citrate. The developed speciation method represents a reliable analytical tool for investigation of the percentage and the amount of Zn-citrate in human milk. Copyright  2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) is thought to be involved in detoxifying several carcinogens and may play a vital role in tumorigenesis. Numerous studies have evaluated the association between GSTM1 null/present polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the results remain inconsistent. To derive a more precise estimation, we performed a meta-analysis.

  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all eligible case-control studies. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. The overall association was significant (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.11-1.48, P=0.001). Moreover, subgroup analyses showed GSTM1 null genotype significantly associated with PCa risk among Asians (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.78, P=0.03) but not among Caucasians (OR=1.12, 95% CI: 0.96-1.31, P=0.16). In addition, we did not find that smoking modified the genotype effect on the risk of PCa.

  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present meta-analysis suggested that GSTM1 null allele was a low-penetrant risk factor for PCa among Asians.

Abstract
  Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of polyhydroxylated sterol derivatives with important regulatory roles in various plant physiological processes. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanism of the antiproliferative activity of natural BRs 28-homocastasterone (28-homoCS) and 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) in hormone-sensitive and -insensitive (LNCaP and DU-145, respectively) human prostate cancer cell lines. The effects of BRs on prostate cancer cells were surveyed using flow cytometry, Western blotting, TUNEL, DNA ladder assays and immunofluorescence analyses. The studied BRs inhibited cell growth and induced G(1) blocks in LNCaP cells accompanied by reductions in cyclin D(1), CDK4/6 and pRb expression. Following BR treatment of DU-145 cells, increases in proportions of cells in the G(2)/M phase of cell cycle were observed, accompanied by down-regulation of cyclins A and B(1). Changes in AR localization patterns in LNCaP cells treated with BRs were shown by immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, apoptotic detection methods demonstrated induction of apoptosis mediated by BRs in both cell lines, although changes in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were modulated differently by 28-homoCS and 24-piBL in each cell line. The studied BRs seem to exert potent growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects and could be therefore highly valuable new candidates for prostate anticancer drugs. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  There is an assumption that pyrethroid pesticides are converted to non-toxic metabolites by hydrolysis in mammals. However, some recent works have shown their bioaccumulation in human breast milk collected in areas where pyrethroids have been widely used for agriculture or malaria control. In this work, thirteen pyrethroids have been studied in human breast milk samples coming from areas without pyrethroid use for malaria control, such as Brazil, Colombia and Spain. The concentrations of pyrethroids ranged from 1.45 to 24.2 ng g-1 lw. Cypermethrin, -cyhalothrin, permethrin and esfenvalerate/fenvalerate were present in all the studied samples. The composition of pyrethroid mixture depended on the country of origin of the samples, bifenthrin being the most abundant in Brazilian samples, -cyhalothrin in Colombian and permethrin in Spanish ones. When the pyrethroid concentrations were confronted against the number of gestations, an exponential decay was observed. Moreover, a time trend study was carried out in Brazil, where additional archived pool samples were analyzed, corresponding to years when pyrethroids were applied for dengue epidemic control. In these cases, total pyrethroid levels reached up to 128 ng g-1 lw, and concentrations decreased when massive use was not allowed. Finally, daily intake estimation of nursing infants was calculated in each country and compared to acceptable WHO levels. The estimated daily intakes for nursing infants were always below the acceptable daily intake levels, nevertheless in certain samples the detected concentrations were very close to the maximum acceptable levels.

Abstract
  Kindlin-2 is engaged in tumor progression. However, the mechanism accounting for Kindlin-2 regulation in tumor cells remained largely unknown. Here, we report a regulatory loop between Kindlin-2 and GLI1, an effector of Hedgehog signaling pathway. We show that Kindlin-2 is transcriptionally downregulated via GLI1 occupancy on the Kindlin-2 promoter. Adversely, we found that Kindlin-2 promotes GLI1 expression through a mechanism involving GSK3 inactivation and is independent of Smoothened. Functionally, knockdown of Kindlin-2 cooperates with cyclopamine, a Smoothened antagonist, to decrease the viability of prostate cancer cells. Taken together, targeting the Kindlin-2-GLI1 feedback loop may facilitate the killing of prostate cancer cells. Copyright  2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: KLLN is a newly identified gene with unknown function and shares a bidirectional promoter with PTEN.

  OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between KILLIN (KLLN) expression and prostate cancer and the potential tumor suppressive effect.

  DESIGN: We conducted an in silico analysis to compare KLLN expression in normal prostate and matched primary carcinoma tissues. We subsequently used immunohistochemistry to examine KLLN expression and association with Gleason grade and score in 109 prostatectomy samples. KLLN's tumor-suppressive effect was studied in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cell models.

  PATIENTS: Patients were diagnosed with peripheral zone prostate carcinomas without metastasis at the time of prostatectomy. Each patient's primary tumor comprised at least 2 tumoral regions with different Gleason grades.

  RESULTS: KLLN expression decreased from normal prostate tissue to primary carcinomas (P < .0001). The loss of epithelial and stromal KLLN expression is associated with poor differentiation and high Gleason scores (P < .0001), consistent with our in vitro observation that KLLN inhibits tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness. KLLN decreases prostate-specific antigen levels and suppresses androgen-mediated cell growth by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) transcription. As an androgen receptor-regulated target, KLLN also functions as a transcriptional activator, directly promoting the expression of TP53 and TP73, with consequent elevated apoptosis, regardless of AR status.

  CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that KLLN is a transcription factor directly regulating AR, TP53, and TP73 expression, with a role in prostate carcinogenesis. Loss of KLLN associates with high Gleason scores, suggesting that KLLN might be used as a potential prognostic marker for risk management and as a novel therapy target for advanced prostate carcinomas.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Fetal growth restraint, if followed by rapid weight gain, confers risk for adult disease including diabetes. How breast-feeding may lower such risk is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE, STUDY PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTION, OUTCOMES: In infants born small-for-gestational-age (SGA), we studied the effects of nutrition in early infancy (breast-feeding vs formula-feeding; BRF vs FOF) on weight partitioning and endocrine markers in late infancy. Body composition (by absorptiometry), fasting glycemia, insulin, IGF-I, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin were assessed at 4 and 12 months in BRF controls born appropriate-for-GA (N = 31) and in SGA infants receiving BRF (N = 48) or FOF (N = 51), the latter being randomized to receive a standard formula (FOF1) or a protein-rich formula (FOF2).

  SETTING: The study was conducted in a University Hospital.

  RESULTS: SGA-BRF infants maintained a low fat mass and normal levels of IGF-I and HMW adiponectin. In contrast, SGA-FOF infants normalized their body composition by gaining more fat; this normalization was accompanied by a marked fall in HMW adiponectinemia and, in FOF2 infants, by elevated IGF-I levels. In late infancy, SGA-BRF infants were most sensitive to insulin, even more sensitive than appropriate-for-GA-BRF controls.

  CONCLUSIONS: Because the health perspectives are better for SGA-BRF than for SGA-FOF infants, the present results suggest that FOF for SGA infants should aim at maintaining normal IGF-I and HMW-adiponectin levels rather than at normalizing body composition. Nutriceutical research for SGA infants may thus have to be redirected.

Abstract
  Metastasis is the primary mediator of prostate cancer (PCA) lethality and poses a significant clinical obstacle. The identification of factors involved in the metastasis of PCA is imperative. We demonstrate herein that trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) promotes PCA cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. The capacity of TFF1 to enhance cell migration/invasion is mediated by transcriptional repression of E-CADHERIN. Consideration of targeted inhibition of TFF1 to prevent metastasis of prostate carcinoma is warranted. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Adherence has not been studied in male oncology populations. The aim of this study on both the prescriber and user perspectives in prostate cancer treatment was to analyse real-life prescribing patterns of anti-androgens (AA), primarily bicalutamide, and factors influencing the patients' adherence to treatment.

  METHODS: A nationwide clinical cohort of incident prostate cancer, PCBaSe, was linked to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Men with a planned first line monotherapy AA treatment were identified; dosages and extent of off-label treatment were investigated. Cumulative incidence proportions for reasons for drug discontinuation were calculated. Factors potentially influencing adherence were explored using the medical possession ratio based on the individual prescribed daily dose.

  RESULTS: First line monotherapy AA was planned in 4.4% of all incident cases and in 2.1% of low risk disease cases. Among 1,406 men prescribed bicalutamide, 1,109 (79%) received the approved daily dose of 150mg. Discontinuation reasons differed with disease severity. Off-label, low-dose prescription associated with age above 75years and disease categorised as low risk was noted in 297 men (21%). Sixty percent of the men adhered well, i.e. to >=80%. Age above 75years and less severe disease were both negatively associated with adherence.

  CONCLUSIONS: Patient age and tumour risk group influenced the prescriber's choice of dose, pointing to important issues for critical reflection. Possible over-treatment was noted in low risk disease. Interventions to increase adherence in older men and in men with less severe disease are worth considering after critically reviewing the appropriateness of the treatment indication, especially in the latter case.

Abstract
  Achieving an appropriate docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status in the neonatal brain is an important goal of neonatal nutrition. We evaluated how different dietary fat matrices improved DHA content in the brains of both male and female rats. Forty rats of each gender were born from dams fed over gestation and lactation with a low -linolenic acid (ALA) diet (0.4% of fatty acids) and subjected for 6 weeks after weaning to a palm oil blend-based diet (10% by weight) that provided either 1.5% ALA or 1.5% ALA and 0.12% DHA with 0.4% arachidonic acid or to an anhydrous dairy fat blend that provided 1.5% or 2.3% ALA. Fatty acids in the plasma, red blood cells (RBCs) and whole brain were determined by gas chromatography. The 1.5% ALA dairy fat was superior to both the 1.5% ALA palm oil blends for increasing brain DHA (14.4% increase, P<.05), and the 2.3% ALA dairy blend exhibited a further increase that could be ascribed to both an ALA increase and n-6/n-3 ratio decrease. Females had significantly higher brain DHA due to a gender-to-diet interaction, with dairy fats attenuating the gender effect. Brain DHA was predicted with a better accuracy by some plasma and RBC fatty acids when used in combination (R(2) of 0.6) than when used individually (R(2)=0.47 for RBC n-3 docosapentaenoic acid at best). In conclusion, dairy fat blends enriched with ALA appear to be an interesting strategy for achieving optimal DHA levels in the brain of postweaning rats. Human applications are worth considering.

Abstract
  -Tocopheryl succinate (-TOS) inhibits oxidative phosphorylation at the level of mitochondrial complex I and II, thus promoting cancer cell death through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Redox imbalance activates NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor involved in cell protection and detoxification responses. Here we examined the involvement of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the regulation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling by short exposure to -TOS in prostate cancer cells. A short-term (4 h) exposure to -TOS causes a significant reduction in cell viability (76%+/-9%) and a moderate rise in ROS production (113%+/-8%). -TOS alters glutathione (GSH) homeostasis by inducing a biphasic effect, i.e., an early (1 h) decrease in intracellular GSH content (56%+/-20%) followed by a threefold rise at 4 h. -TOS increases nuclear translocation and electrophile-responsive/antioxidant-responsive elements binding activity of Nrf2, resulting in up-regulation of downstream genes cystine-glutamic acid exchange transporter and HO-1, while decreasing NF-kB nuclear translocation. This effect is suppressed by the pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 and mimicked by the end-products of HO activity, i.e., bilirubin and carbon monoxide. Results suggest a little understood mechanism for -TOS-induced inhibition of NF-kB nuclear translocation due to HO-1 up-regulation. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Whey protein concentrates (WPCs) enhance innate mucosal immunity during early life and have a protective role in some immune disorders. To further elucidate the potential benefits of this protein, the present study investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with WPCs on blood parameters, plasma cytokine profiles, and immune cell proliferation and chemotaxis. A total of 45 male mice were equally distributed into three experimental groups and treated daily for 21 days as follows: group I was a control group that was orally supplemented with distilled water, group II was orally supplemented with undenatured WP (100 mg/kg body weight), and group III was orally supplemented with bovine serum albumin (100 mg/kg body weight). We found that the plasma cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-1, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor- and the levels of reactive oxygen species, cholesterol, triglycerides and the lipid profile were significantly decreased in the WP-treated group compared to the control group. In contrast, the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8 and glutathione were significantly elevated, and consequently, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to proliferate in response to stimulation with different antigens was significantly increased in the WP-treated group. Moreover, the in vitro chemotaxis of B, T and bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells toward CC chemokine ligand-21 and CXC chemokine ligand-12 was significantly increased, by twofold, in WP-treated mice compared to the control group. Taken together, our data reveal the benefits of WP supplementation in enhancing immune cell proliferation and migration to the secondary lymphoid organs. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  The objective of this study was to determine the release and bioaccessibility of -carotene from fortified almond butter using in vitro digestion models. Two types of fortifiers were investigated: -carotene oil (oil) and whey protein isolate (WPI)-alginate-chitosan capsules containing -carotene oil (capsule). Shaking water bath and Human Gastric Simulator (HGS) digestion models assessed the impact of gastric peristalsis on the release of -carotene. Bioaccessibility of -carotene was measured as percent recovered from the micelle fraction. There was greater release of -carotene from oil fortified almond butter in the HGS model (87.1%) due to peristalsis than the shaking water bath model (51.0%). More -carotene was released from capsule fortified almond butter during intestinal digestion. However, more -carotene was recovered from the micelle fraction of oil fortified almond butter. These results suggest that a WPI-alginate-chitosan capsule coating may inhibit the bioaccessibility of -carotene from fortified almond butter.

Abstract
  The ability of the spectrophotometric thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) test to determine malondialdehyde (MDA) in various food matrices was evaluated. MDA was extracted from the foods; the extract reacted with thiobarbituric acid (TBA); and the formed TBA-MDA adduct was measured spectrophotometricaly at 532 nm. In parallel, the TBA-MDA adduct was analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with fluorescence detection. Oils and unprocessed and uncooked meat and fish products did not exhibit any significant difference in the amount of MDA measured by the two methods, indicating that the major substance reacting with TBA and forming an adduct that absorbs at 532 nm was MDA. However, in products such as dry nuts, pork sausages, cooked fish, and gouda cheese, an overestimation of MDA was observed, indicating that TBARS test was unsuitable for accurate determination of MDA. Furthermore, the results in the present work suggest that the overestimation of MDA by the TBARS test as it was applied is related to the interference of other than secondary lipid oxidation products.

  Modifications ofAOAC Official Method 999.15 to improve the quantitation of vitamin K1 in complex formulated nutritional products.

Abstract
  Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) occurs in foods in relatively low concentrations. It is synthesized for addition to formulated nutritional products (infant formulas, medical foods, and adult nutritional products). In recent years, nutritional products formulated with free amino acids and partially hydrolyzed proteins have been introduced in the market. Schimpf et al. demonstrated that the current AOAC Official Method 999.15 for determination of vitamin K in milk and infant formula is not adequate to quantitatively extract vitamin K1 from such products. We developed a modification of AOAC 999.15 for the analysis of vitamin K1 in these products that provides quantitative extraction by increasing the sample size, volume of extraction solvents, time of liquid/liquid partitioning, and order of the addition of solvents. This modified procedure showed extraction efficiency comparable to that of the original AOAC 999.15 procedure for analyzing infant formula matrixes and to the modified procedure of Schimpf et al. for the analysis of samples containing limited amounts of free amino acids andlor partially hydrolyzed proteins. Extraction efficiency increased more than 10% using the modified extraction procedure for samples containing higher amounts of these components. The chromatographic separation was improved by using a Dionex Acclaim triacontanol-bonded C30 column (250 x 3.0 mm id, 3 pm particle size) maintained at 15 degrees C, with acetonitrile-methanol (50 + 50, v/v) mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, which provided baseline separation of the cis and trans isomers of vitamin K1 from each other and from other compounds contained in the sample extracts.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The extensive use of prostate-specific antigen as a general prostate cancer biomarker has introduced the hazards of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Recent studies have revealed the immense biomarker capacity of microRNAs (miRNAs) in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression pattern of miR-224, a cancer-related miRNA, in prostate tumors and investigate its clinical utility.

  METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from 139 prostate tissue samples. After the polyadenylation of total RNA by poly(A) polymerase, cDNA was synthesized with a suitable poly(T) adapter. miR-224 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and analyzed with the comparative quantification cycle method, C(q)(2(-Cq)). We performed comprehensive biostatistical analyses to explore the clinical value of miR-224 in prostate cancer.

  RESULTS: miR-224 expression was significantly downregulated in malignant samples compared with benign samples (P < 0.001). Higher miR-224 expression levels were found in prostate tumors that were less aggressive (P = 0.017) and in an earlier disease stage (P = 0.018). Patients with prostate cancer who were positive for miR-224 had significantly enhanced progression-free survival intervals compared with miR-224-negative patients (P = 0.021). Univariate bootstrap Cox regression confirmed that miR-224 was associated with favorable prognosis (hazard ratio 0.314, P = 0.013); nonetheless, multivariate analysis, adjusted for conventional markers, did not identify miR-224 as an independent prognostic indicator.

  CONCLUSIONS: miR-224 is aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer. Its assessment by cost-effective quantitative molecular methodologies could provide a useful biomarker for prostate cancer.  2012 American Association for Clinical Chemistry

Abstract
  Development of successful vaccines against glycotopes remains a major challenge. In the current studies, we have successfully developed a novel carrier protein for glycotopes based on the concept of antigen clustering and specific stimulation of T helper cells to mount strong antibody response to glycotopes. The bipartite carrier protein consists of a tandem repeat of a cysteine-rich peptide for docking of clustered glycotopes to effectively activate B cells and an Fc domain for antigen delivery to antigen presenting cells (APCs). To demonstrate its utility, we conjugated the tumor-specific monosaccharide antigen Tn to this novel carrier protein and successfully developed a Tn vaccine against cancer in animal models. The Tn vaccine effectively elicited high-titer IgG1 antibodies against Tn in immunized mice, and effectively suppressed the development of prostate cancer in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mice. Our results suggest that this novel bipartite carrier protein could be effectively used for developing anti-glycotope vaccines such as the anticancer Tn vaccine. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  The effects of high pressure (HP) treatment (100-400 MPa at 10-60 C) on the solubility of milk protein concentrate (MPC) powders were tested. The solubility, measured at 20 C, of fresh MPC powders made with no HP treatment was 66%. It decreased by 10% when stored for 6 weeks at ambient temperature (~20 C) and continued to decrease to less than 50% of its initial solubility after 12 months of storage. Of the combinations of pressure and heat used, a pressure of 200 MPa at 40 C applied to the concentrate before spray drying was found to be the most beneficial for improved solubility of MPC powders. This combination of pressure/heat improved the initial cold water solubility to 85%. The solubility was maintained at this level after 6 weeks storage at ambient temperature and 85% of the initial solubility was preserved after 12 months. The improved solubility of MPC powders on manufacture and on storage are attributed to an altered surface composition arising from an increased concentration of non-micellar casein in the milk due to HP treatment prior to drying. The improved solubility of high protein powders (95% protein) made from blends of sodium caseinate and whey protein isolate compared with MPC powders (~85% protein) made from ultrafiltered/diafiltered milk confirmed the detrimental role of micellar casein on solubility. The results suggest that increasing the non-micellar casein content by HP treatment of milk or use of blends of sodium caseinate and whey proteins are strategies that may be used to obtain high protein milk powders with enhanced solubility.

Abstract
  Genes in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) pathway play a central role in regulation of milk fat synthesis, especially the de-novo synthesis of saturated fatty acids. SCD, a SREBP-responsive gene, is the key enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids in the mammary gland. In the present study, we discovered SNP in candidate genes associated with this signalling pathway and SCD to identify genetic markers that can be used for genetic and metabolically directed selection in cattle. We resequenced six candidate genes in the SREBP1 pathway (SREBP1, SCAP, INSIG1, INSIG2, MBTPS1, MBTPS2) and two genes for SCD (SCD1 and SCD5) and discovered 47 Tag SNP that were used in a marker-trait association study. Milk and blood samples were collected from Holstein cows in their 1st or 2nd parity at 100-150 days of lactation. Individual fatty acids from C4 to C20, saturated fatty acid (SFA) content, monounsaturated fatty acid content, polyunsaturated fatty acid content and desaturase indexes were measured and used to perform the asociation analysis. Polymorphisms in the SCD5 and INSIG2 genes were the most representative markers associated with SFA/unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) ratio in milk. The analysis of desaturation activity determined that markers in the SCD1 and SCD5 genes showed the most significant effects. DGAT1 K232A marker was included in the study to examine the effect of this marker on the variation of milk fatty acids in our Holstein population. The percentage of variance explained by DGAT1 in the analysis was only 6% of SFA/UFA ratio. Milk fat depression was observed in one of the dairy herds and in this particular dairy one SNP in the SREBP1 gene (rs41912290) accounted for 40% of the phenotypic variance. Our results provide detailed SNP information for key genes in the SREBP1 signalling pathway and SCD that can be used to change milk fat composition by marker-assisted breeding to meet consumer demands regarding human health, as well as furthering understanding of technological aspects of cows' milk.

Abstract
  Dietary estrogens may play a role in the etiology of hormone-dependent cancers like breast cancer. Cow's milk contains various endogenous estrogens and feed derived phytoestrogens that potentially contribute to an estrogenic effect of milk in consumers, and therefore we evaluated the effect of milk (whey) in a proliferation assay with estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Milk samples were obtained from 22 cows representing different stages of pregnancy (first and second half) and whey was produced from the milk. 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5% whey was included in the cell culture medium and after 6 days of treatment cell proliferation was assessed by a colorimetric method with a fluorometer. Whey induced significant (P<0.05) proliferative effects compared with control cells with no added whey at all concentrations tested. There was no difference in the proliferative effect of whey depending on the stage of pregnancy from which the milk was obtained. We did not observe anti-proliferative effects when whey was tested in the presence of 10 pm estradiol in the medium. In conclusion, these results indicate that whey, irrespective of the pregnancy stage from which the milk was obtained induced a significant proliferative response in MCF-7 cells and no anti-proliferative effect, which may be caused, at least in part, by estrogens present in milk. The implications of our findings in relation to for example breast cancer will have to be studied further in other model systems preferentially in vivo.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Abiraterone and docetaxel are both approved treatments for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Abiraterone pre-docetaxel is currently undergoing evaluation in a phase III study. In vitro studies indicate that taxanes may act by disrupting androgen receptor signalling. We hypothesised that prior abiraterone exposure would adversely impact docetaxel efficacy.

  PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated activity of docetaxel in mCRPC patients previously treated with abiraterone, using Prostate Cancer Working Group and radiological criteria.

  RESULTS: Of the 54 patients treated with abiraterone, 35 subsequently received docetaxel. Docetaxel resulted in a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of >=50% in nine patients [26%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 43%], with a median time to PSA progression of 4.6 months (95% CI 4.2% to 5.9%). PSA declines >=30% were achieved by 13 patients (37%, 95% CI 22% to 55%). The median overall survival was 12.5 months (95% CI 10.6-19.4). All patients who failed to achieve a PSA fall on abiraterone and were deemed abiraterone-refractory were also docetaxel-refractory (N = 8). In the 24 patients with radiologically evaluable disease, partial responses were reported in four patients (11%), none of whom were abiraterone-refractory.

  CONCLUSION: The activity of docetaxel post-abiraterone appears lower than anticipated and no responses to docetaxel were observed in abiraterone-refractory patients.

Abstract
  The objective of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of UV light and heat treatment on vitamins A, B(2), C, and E in cow and goat milk. Vitamins were analyzed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Ultraviolet and pasteurization treatments caused loss in vitamin C in milk. Pasteurization did not have any significant effect on vitamin B(2). However, UV light treatment decreased the amount of vitamin B(2) after several passes of milk through the UV system. In addition, UV light treatment decreased the amount of vitamins A and E. Vitamins C and E are more sensitive to UV light. UV light sensitivities of vitamins were C>E>A>B(2). These results show that UV light treatment decreases the vitamin content in milk. Also, the number of passes through the UV system and the initial amount of vitamins in milk are important factors affecting vitamin levels. Copyright  2012 American Dairy Science Association.

Abstract
  The composition of milk fat from dairy cows is related to both genetic and environmental factors. Here, the effect of feed and herd was examined in 3 Scandinavian breeds, namely Danish Holstein-Friesian (DH), Danish Jersey (DJ), and Swedish Red (SR). In total, milk samples from 1,298 cows kept in indoor housing systems were collected from 61 conventional dairy herds in Denmark and Sweden. The fatty acid (FA) composition of milk was determined by gas chromatography and the content of -tocopherol by HPLC. Based on the 17 individual FA determined, distinct FA profiles were observed for all breeds using univariate and multivariate statistics. The DJ cows were characterized by higher levels of saturated short-chain FA; in contrast, DH cows had higher content of unsaturated C18 FA, whereas higher levels of primarily C14:0, C14:1, C18:1 cis-9, and C18:3n-3 were evident in SR cows. This variation in milk fat composition across breeds was further reflected in different desaturase indices, which were generally higher in SR cows. In addition, -tocopherol differed significantly among breeds, with DJ cows having the highest content. Herd-specific feeding plans were collected, and different feed items were separated into 4 broad feed categories, including grass products, maize silage, grain, and concentrate. The pronounced differences in overall feed composition among breeds were, to a large extent, due to regional differences between countries, with SR receiving higher levels of grain and grass silage compared with the Danish breeds. Within breeds, differences in feeding regimens among herds were furthermore higher in SR. Significant correlations between feed category and individual FA were observed in all breeds. Furthermore, variance components were estimated and used to determine the proportion of phenotypic variation that could be explained by herd. The herd effect for individual FA was generally lower for DH compared with the 2 other breeds. In addition, very low herd effects were shown for C14:1 and C16:1 in all breeds, suggesting that the content of these FA is mainly genetically regulated.

Abstract
  During the transition from pregnancy to lactation, the sudden increase in nutrient demand for milk production causes metabolic perturbations and is associated with immunosuppression and a high incidence of metabolic and infectious diseases in high-yielding cows. In this study, we examined whether limiting milk harvest postpartum while maintaining milking stimulus could improve the metabolic status of cows without reducing overall milk production. Forty-seven Holstein cows were milked completely twice a day from calving (control); milked incompletely (about one-third of expected milk production was collected) twice a day until d 5 after calving (incomplete); or left to nurse their calf until d 5 and milked once a day from d 3 to d 5 (nursing). All cows were milked twice a day from d 6 to the end of the experiment (d 61). During the treatment period (d 1 to 5), milk production averaged 27.3 and 9.7 kg/d for the control and incomplete treatments, respectively. We observed no residual effect of treatment on milk production, which averaged 47.8, 45.7, and 46.4 kg/d for the control, incomplete, and nursing treatments, respectively, between wk 2 and 9. The dry matter intake of the cows was similar during and after treatment. From wk 2 to 9, milk protein and lactose percentage were not affected by treatments, but milk fat tended to be higher in control cows than in cows milked partially (incomplete + nursing). Blood concentrations of glucose and phosphorus were lower and concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and -hydroxybutyrate were higher in control cows than in partially milked cows during the treatment period. The positive effects on glucose and -hydroxybutyrate remained significant up to d 28. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation and secretion of IL-4 were depressed during the postpartum period, and proliferation tended to be greater for cells incubated in serum from cows in the incomplete treatment on d 5 but lower on d 61. We observed no effect of treatments on polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte chemotaxis or phagocytosis. Proliferation and IL-4 secretion of PBMC were negatively correlated with concentration of serum nonesterified fatty acids. Reducing milk harvest postpartum while maintaining milking stimuli reduced metabolic stress without compromising productivity of high-yielding dairy cows.

Abstract
  To exert their beneficial effects, probiotics need to survive in the stringent conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Symbiosis between different bacteria is a potential way of enhancing this survival. In developing new probiotic cultures, we investigated the synergic effect between Enterococcus mundtii IFO 13712 and 7 strains of Lactococcus lactis, many of which are widely used as starter bacteria for making dairy products and have probiotic properties. The growth yield of a mixed culture of L. lactis strain Y and IFO 13712 in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth was greater than that of a single culture. Supernatant from culture of strain IFO 13712 enhanced the growth of strain Y, but that of strain Y did not enhance the growth of strain IFO 13712. This commensalism phenomenon was confirmed by using a simpler tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYG) broth. Increased cell yield in mixed culture of the 2 strains compared with single cultures was observed in TYG broth in the presence of both Tween 80 and citrate but not in TYG broth alone or TYG broth containing either Tween 80 or citrate. Thus, the Tween 80 and citrate in the broth contributed to the commensalism. Metabolite analysis revealed that ethanol production in the co-metabolism of glucose and citrate by strain Y was suppressed by mixed culture in TYG broth containing Tween 80 and citrate, compared with that in TYG broth containing citrate alone. The mechanism supporting the observed commensal symbiosis between strains Y and IFO 13712 was the increase in availability of glucose for lactate production by strain Y because, in glycolysis, the pathway from glucose to lactate is energic, whereas the pathway from glucose to ethanol is not. Whether growth stimulation of strain Y by mixing it with IFO 13712 in milk products will enhance the survival of strain Y in the intestine remains to be elucidated.

Abstract
  This paper describes a study on the influence of the high-pressure-release rate on the protein distribution between the soluble and colloidal fractions of milk. Skim milk, without or with sulfhydryl-blocking agents, was pressure treated at 250 and 350 MPa for 5 to 15 min at 25 C, applying different pressure-release rates (pressure-release times between 0.07 to 10 min). The liberation of caseins to the soluble phase and the denaturation of whey proteins were assessed. A significantly higher increase in the content of soluble casein took place during the pressure-release phase as compared with a pressure-holding phase. Denaturation of -lactoglobulin mainly took place by -SH-S-S exchange reactions during the holding phase. The present results, thus, show a negligible influence of whey proteins on the increase in the content of nonsedimentable casein in pressure-treated milk and provide evidence for the importance of the pressure-release rate in this process, so that the slower the pressure release rate, the higher the level of soluble casein.

Abstract
  Skim milk, butter-derived aqueous phase, butter oil, and fish oil (3 levels) were used to produce UHT pasteurized n-3 fatty acid-fortified beverages (3.1% fat, 3.9% protein, and 11.5% total solids) with targeted deliveries of 200, 500, and 800 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (combined total) per 250 mL (8 fl oz) serving. Microbial quality, emulsion stability, and oxidation of lipids over 35 d of storage at 4 C were evaluated. Conjugated diene hydroperoxides were below 1% throughout storage and were found at highest concentrations around d 21 of storage for all formulations. Volatile analysis indicated an increase in 1-penten-3-ol in the n-3 fortified dairy-based beverage systems during storage. Triangle tests were conducted to determine if consumers could detect a difference in aroma, compared with commercially processed aseptically packaged milk. The beverage system with targeted delivery of 500 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid per 250-mL serving was not different in aroma compared with commercially available UHT processed milk. This formulation delivered 432 mg of heart-healthy n-3 fatty acids per 250-mL serving on d 35 and was microbiologically and physically stable throughout the 35-d refrigerated storage period.

Abstract
  The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of composite -k-CN genotypes on milk coagulation and composition traits, and on the additive genetic variation of these traits in Estonian Holstein dairy cattle. A total of 23,970 milk samples, repeated measurements from the first to third lactation from 2,859 Estonian Holstein cows from 78 herds across the country, were analyzed for milk yield, milk fat and protein percentages, somatic cell count, and milk coagulation properties (milk coagulation time and curd firmness). Each cow had at least 3 measurements per lactation. Two single-trait random regression animal models were fitted for the traits studied. The first model considered fixed effects of year-season of sampling and year-season of calving, calving age (nested within lactation), sample age (only for milk coagulation traits) and days in milk, and random herd, additive genetic, and permanent environmental effects. The animal and permanent environmental effects were modeled over the lactation period by using Legendre polynomials. The second model had the additional fixed -k-casein effect in the form of a third-order Legendre polynomial. The 2 most frequent -k-casein composite genotypes were A2A2AA and A1A2AA, both with prevalence greater than 20%. Percentages of the remaining 31 genotypes were less than 8%, including 20 genotypes with percentages less than 1%. The -k-casein genotype-specific lactation curves were significantly different for milk coagulation traits and milk protein percentage. The B variant of k-casein showed a favorable effect on both milk coagulation traits, whereas the IB haplotype had an increasing effect on curd firmness and protein percentage. Inclusion of the -k-casein genotype effects in the model resulted in decreases in the mean additive genetic variations for milk coagulation time and curd firmness of 12.9 and 51.1%, respectively.

Abstract
  Telomere length variation may provide a quantitative measure of the effects of dairy management and selection practices on animal stress and welfare. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between telomere length in Holstein cattle with age, herd, and survival. A multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) procedure was utilized to estimate telomere length for 201 Holstein cows from 10 herds following DNA extraction from blood. Primers were designed to amplify a 79-bp telomere product and a 144-bp product of a standard reference gene (-globin). Both primer sets were included in the same reaction well to enable the analysis of relative quantity (qT) of telomere product compared with -globin product. Triplicate samples were run for each cow, and mixed models were used to analyze the qPCR results. Younger cows were significantly associated with higher qT, and significant variation was observed among herds for qT. Cows with short telomeres were more likely to be culled in the subsequent year than cows with above-average telomere lengths. Multiplex qPCR provides a cost-effective method of assessing telomere length. Variation in telomere length might provide insights into how management practices and genetic selection influence cow stress and physiological responses to stress.

Abstract
  Betaine, naturally found in plants and an oxidative product of choline, is converted to acetate in the rumen, which may be used for milk fat synthesis. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of supplemental dietary betaine on milk yield and milk composition. Eighteen Holstein dairy cows (126+/-5 d in milk; mean +/- SD) were randomly assigned to a sequence of treatments of rumen-unprotected betaine at 0, 25, 50, and 100 g/d added to a standard lactation ration in a 4x4 Latin square design. Animals were fed individually with feed intake and milk yield recorded daily. Body condition score and body weight were recorded on the last day of each period that lasted 16 d, with milk sampled on the last 2 d of each period. Milk composition was determined by a Dairy Herd Improvement Association laboratory and milk fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. Data collected over the last 2 to 3 d were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Milk yield (mean +/- SEM) was increased by betaine when fed at 100g/d (22.4, 22.5, 22.8, 24.1+/-1.19 kg/d for 0, 25, 50, and 100g of betaine/d, respectively). No effect of dietary betaine was detected on dry matter intake, feed efficiency, body weight, or body condition score. Percentages of milk fat, lactose, solids-not-fat, and somatic cell count were not altered; however, protein concentration was decreased by betaine supplementation as compared with the control (3.35, 3.28, 3.27, and 3.28+/-0.07% for 0, 25, 50, and 100 g of betaine/d, respectively). Daily yields of milk protein, fat, lactose, energy-corrected milk, and 3.5% fat-corrected milk did not differ with betaine supplementation. Overall, inclusion of dietary betaine at 100 g/d increased milk yield, whereas all levels of betaine supplementation decreased milk protein percent and slightly altered milk fatty acid profile. Further studies are needed to determine the ruminal fermentation characteristics and the optimum rate of supplemental betaine for dairy cows. Copyright  2012 American Dairy Science Association.

Abstract
  The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of composite CSN1S1-CSN3 [(S1)-k-casein (CN)] genotype on milk protein composition in Mediterranean water buffalo. Content of (S1)-CN, (S2)-CN, -CN, -CN, k-CN, glycosylated and unglycosylated k-CN, -lactalbumin, and -lactoglobulin was measured by reversed-phase HPLC using 621 individual milk samples. Genotypes at CSN1S1 and CSN3 were also obtained by reversed-phase HPLC. Two alleles were detected at CSN1S1 (corresponding to the A and B variants, O62823: p.Leu193Ser,) and at CSN3 (corresponding to the X1 and X2 variants, CAP12622.1: p.Ile156Thr). Increased proportions of (S1)-CN in total casein (TCN) were associated with genotypes carrying CSN1S1 A. Genotypes associated with a marked decrease of the proportion of (S1)-CN in TCN (composite genotypes AB-X1X1 and BB-X1X2) were associated with marked increases in the proportion of (S2)-CN. In addition, composite genotypes carrying the X1 allele at CSN3 were associated with a greater proportion of (S2)-CN in TCN relative to those carrying CSN3 X2. Composite genotypes greatly affected also the variability of ratios of k-CN to TCN, with genotypes carrying the X1 allele at CSN3 being associated with decreased ratios. The decreased content of glycosylated k-CN associated with CSN3 X1 was responsible for the overall lower content of total k-CN in milk of X1-carrying animals. Increasing the frequency of specific genotypes might be an effective way to alter milk protein composition, namely the proportion of (S1)-CN, (S2)-CN, and k-CN in TCN, and the degree of glycosylation of k-CN.

Abstract
  The objective of this study was to evaluate transition cow performance when brown midrib corn silage (BMRCS; Mycogen F2F444) was included in the diet during the transition period, and to determine if any production response occurring during the first 3 wk of lactation would persist from wk 4 to 15 when a common diet was fed. Seventy Holstein dairy cows were blocked by parity (either second or third and greater) and calving date and randomly assigned to the CCS (a mixture of varieties of conventional corn silage) or BMRCS treatment. Diets were formulated with the objective of keeping all ration parameters the same, with the exception of neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Neutral detergent fiber digestibility values (30 h) for CCS and BMRCS averaged 56.8 and 73.8%, respectively. Prepartum rations contained 47% corn silage, 18% wheat straw, 7% alfalfa haylage, and 28% concentrate, and averaged 45% neutral detergent fiber (DM basis). Postpartum rations contained 40% corn silage, 15% alfalfa haylage, 1% straw, and 44% concentrate. Milk weights (3x/d) and dry matter intake were recorded daily, and milk composition was measured weekly. Cows fed BMRCS had higher dry matter intake during the 2-wk period before calving (14.3 vs. 13.2 kg/d) and the 3-wk period after calving (20.1 vs. 18.1 kg/d) than did cows fed CCS. Yields of milk, solids, and lactose were increased, whereas a trend was observed for a reduction in somatic cell counts and linear scores in the postpartum period for cows receiving BMRCS during the transition. A significant carryover effect of BMRCS was observed on production from wk 4 to 15 when the common diet was fed, with yields of protein (1.36 vs. 1.30 kg/d), lactose (2.24 vs. 2.12 kg/d), and solids (5.82 vs. 5.51 kg/d) increasing significantly, and yields of fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and fat tending to increase during this period for cows that had been fed BMRCS. The increased intakes during the last 2 wk of the prepartum period in the BMRCS treatment were likely because of a reduction in fill, whereas the increased intakes in the postpartum period in cows fed the BMRCS were either because of the higher intakes during the prepartum period or because of a reduction in fill limitations in the postpartum period. The carryover response in wk 4 to 15 may have resulted from cows that received BMRCS during the transition period being in a more positive nutrient balance than cows fed CCS. The results of this study indicate the importance that digestible NDF can have in transition diets and the long-term production responses that can occur when intake is increased in the transition period.

Abstract
  Milk fat secretion is a complex process that initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum of the mammary epithelial cell by the budding of lipid droplets. Lipid droplets are finally released as fat globules in milk enveloped by the apical plasma membrane of the mammary epithelial cell. The milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) thus comprises membrane-specific proteins and polar lipids (glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids) surrounding a core of neutral lipids (mainly triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters). We have recently described major proteins of the MFGM in the goat and we have highlighted prominent differences between goats and bovine species, especially regarding lactadherin, a major MFGM protein. Here, we show that, in the goat species, the well-documented genetic polymorphism at the (s1)-casein (CSN1S1) locus affects both structure and composition of milk fat globules. We first evidenced that both milk fat globule size and -potential are related to the (s1)-casein genotype. At midlactation, goats displaying strong genotypes for (s1)-casein (A/A goats) produce larger fat globules than goats with a null genotype at the CSN1S1 locus (O/O goats). A linear relationship (R(2)=0.75) between fat content (g/kg) in the milk and diameter of fat globules (um) was established. Moreover, we found significant differences with regard to MFGM composition (including both polar lipids and MFGM proteins) from goats with extreme genotype at the CSN1S1 locus. At midlactation, the amount of polar lipids is significantly higher in the MFGM from goats with null genotypes for (s1)-casein (O/O goats; 5.97+/-0.11mg/g of fat; mean +/- standard deviation) than in the MFGM from goats with strong genotypes for (s1)-casein (A/A goats; 3.96+/-0.12mg/g of fat; mean +/- standard deviation). Two MFGM-associated proteins, namely lactadherin and stomatin, are also significantly upregulated in the MFGM from goats with null genotype for (s1)-casein at early lactation. Our findings are discussed with regard to techno-functional properties and nutritional value of goat milk. In addition, the genetic polymorphism in the goat species appears to be a tool to provide clues to the lipid secretion pathways in the mammary epithelial cell.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) generate millions of reads and hundreds of datasets, and there is an urgent need for a better way to accurately interpret and distill such large amounts of data. Extensive pathway and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease vs. healthy samples in the NGS and GWAS. Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to elucidation of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient stratification studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying anti-cancer drug effects. There are approximately 141 biological human pathway resources as of Jan 2012 according to the Pathguide database. However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as disease-pathway, drug-pathway, and organ-pathway associations. Systematically integrating pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the interrelationships between signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease susceptibility, and organ specificity from high-throughput omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).

  RESULTS: We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis (IPAD, http://bioinfo.hsc.unt.edu/ipad), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity, based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data sources.IPAD is a comprehensive database covering about 22,498 genes, 25,469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the BioCarta, KEGG, NCI-Nature curated, Reactome, CTD, PharmGKB, DrugBank, PharmGKB, and HOMER. The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and organ.Moreover, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study.

  CONCLUSIONS: IPAD is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current IPAD database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease studies.

Abstract
  The forkhead protein FoxA1 has functions other than a pioneer factor, in that its depletion brings about a significant redistribution in the androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) cistromes. In this study, we found a novel function for FoxA1 in defining the cell-type specificity of AR- and GR-binding events in a distinct fashion, namely, for AR in LNCaP-1F5 cells and for GR in VCaP cells. We also found different, cell-type and receptor-specific compilations of cis-elements enriched adjacent to the AR- and GR-binding sites. The AR pathway is central in prostate cancer biology, but the role of GR is poorly known. We find that AR and GR cistromes and transcription programs exhibit significant overlap, and GR regulates a large number of genes considered to be AR pathway-specific. This raises questions about the role of GR in maintaining the AR pathway under androgen-deprived conditions in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. However, in the presence of androgen, ligand-occupied GR acts as a partial antiandrogen and attenuates the AR-dependent transcription program. . 2012 AACR

Abstract
  Excess intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) beyond a threshold can induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, the signal pathways that can augment the proapoptotic function of ROS remain largely unknown. We previously identified a tumor suppressor, alpha-tocopherol-associated protein (TAP), yet little is known regarding the role of TAP in the apoptotic signaling in prostate cancer. Interestingly, we recently found that exposure of prostate cancer cells to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2) ) resulted in induced apoptosis as well as increased expression of TAP. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated silencing of endogenous TAP expression conferred effective protection from H(2)O(2) -induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic study showed exposure of prostate cancer cells to H(2)O(2) resulted in increased phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun, and TAP siRNA effectively decreased H(2)O(2) -induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that JNK physically associates with TAP. Furthermore, signaling downstream of JNK to the AP-1 complex and BH-3-only subfamily were found to be regulated on changing the TAP expression status. TAP could also promote the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis effect of docetaxel. In the mice xenograft model, H(2)O(2) treatment induced TAP expression, JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis of prostate cancer. Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2)-TAP injection significantly sensitizes this H(2)O(2) proapoptotic effect. Together, we have identified a novel functional mechanism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Disrupting the redox balance of cancer cells by this signaling may enable therapeutic selectivity and provide benefit to overcome the drug resistance of prostate cancer. Copyright  2012 UICC.

Abstract
  Chrysanthemum indicum L. has been shown to possess antiinflammatory and anticancer activities, but its molecular targets/pathways are not yet fully understood in tumor cells. In the present study, the potential effects of C. indicum on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in different tumor cells were examined. The solvent fractions (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and BuOH,) were obtained from a crude extract (80% EOH extract) of C. indicum. The methylene chloride fraction of C. indicum (MCI) exhibited strong cytotoxic activity as compared with the other fractions and clearly suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation against both DU145 and U266 cells, but not MDA-MB-231 cells. The suppression of constitutive STAT3 activation by MCI is associated with blocking upstream JAK1 and JAK2, but not Src. MCI downregulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products; this is correlated with the accumulation of the cell cycle at sub-G1 phase, the induction of caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis. Moreover, the major components of the MCI were bioactive compounds such as sudachitin, hesperetin, chrysoeriol, and acacetin. Sudachitin, chrysoeriol, and acacetin also exerted significantly cytotoxicity, clearly suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation, and induced apoptosis, although hesperetin did not show any significant effect in DU145 cells. Overall, our results demonstrate that MCI could induce apoptosis through inhibition of the JAK1/2 and STAT3 signaling pathways. Copyright  2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The treatment of cancer with oncolytic viruses primarily depends on the selective viral replication in cancer cells. However, a replication-incompetent hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; Sendai virus) envelope (HVJ-E) suppresses the growth of human cancer cells as effectively as replication-competent live HVJ without producing toxic effects in nonmalignant cells. Here, we analyze the molecular mechanism of the oncolytic activity of HVJ-E.

  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The molecules responsible for HVJ-E-induced cancer cell death were elucidated in prostate cancer cell lines, and the effect of HVJ-E on orthotopic prostate cancers was evaluated in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice.

  RESULTS: The liposome-mediated transfer of viral RNA genome fragments from HVJ-E suppressed the viability of prostate cancer cells but not the viability of the noncancerous prostate epithelium. Knockdown experiments using siRNAs showed that the cancer cell-selective killing induced by HVJ-E was mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Downstream of the RIG-I/MAVS pathway, both TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Noxa were upregulated by HVJ-E in the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not in the noncancerous prostate epithelial cell line PNT2. TRAIL siRNA but not Noxa siRNA significantly inhibited HVJ-E-induced cell death in PC3 cells. However, Noxa siRNA effectively suppressed HVJ-E-induced cell death in DU145 cells, another castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line, in which Noxa but not TRAIL was upregulated by HVJ-E. Furthermore, the orthotopic prostate cancers were dramatically eradicated in immunodeficient mice injected with HVJ-E.

  CONCLUSION: The RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway represents an attractive target for cancer therapy. 2012 AACR.

Abstract
  High-protein diets have been shown to promote weight loss, to improve glucose homeostasis and to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. We aimed to study whether leucine supplementation is able to mimic the alleviating effects of high-protein diets on metabolic syndrome parameters in mice fed high-fat diet. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed for 20 weeks with semisynthetic high-fat diets (20% w/w of fat) containing either an adequate (10% protein, AP) or high (50% protein, HP) amount of whey protein, or an AP diet supplemented with L-leucine corresponding to the leucine content of the HP diet (6% leucine, AP+L). Body weight and composition, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, hepatic triacylglycerols (TG), plasma parameters as well as expression levels of mRNA and proteins in different tissues were measured. HP feeding resulted in decreased body weight, body fat and hepatic TG accumulation, as well as increased insulin sensitivity compared to AP. This was linked to an increased total and resting energy expenditure (REE), decreased feed energy efficiency, increased skeletal muscle (SM) protein synthesis, reduced hepatic lipogenesis and increased white fat lipolysis. Leucine supplementation had effects that were intermediate between HP and AP with regard to body composition, liver TG content, insulin sensitivity, REE and feed energy efficiency, and similar effects as HP on SM protein synthesis. However, neither HP nor AP+L showed an activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in SM. Leucine supplementation had no effect on liver lipogenesis and white fat lipolysis compared to AP. It is concluded that the essential amino acid leucine is able to mimic part but not all beneficial metabolic effects of HP diets. Copyright  2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  It has been demonstrated in various animal models that the oral administration of green tea (GT) extracts in drinking water can inhibit tumor growth, but the effects of brewed GT on factors promoting tumor growth, including oxidant damage of DNA and protein, angiogenesis and DNA methylation, have not been tested in an animal model. To explore these potential mechanisms, brewed GT was administered instead of drinking water to male severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice with androgen-dependent human LAPC4 prostate cancer cell subcutaneous xenografts. Tumor volume was decreased significantly in mice consuming GT, and tumor size was significantly correlated with GT polyphenol (GTP) content in tumor tissue. There was a significant reduction in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression. GT consumption significantly reduced oxidative DNA and protein damage in tumor tissue as determined by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine/deoxyguanosine ratio and protein carbonyl assay, respectively. Methylation is known to inhibit antioxidative enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase pi to permit reactive oxygen species promotion of tumor growth. GT inhibited tumor 5-cytosine DNA methyltransferase 1 mRNA and protein expression significantly, which may contribute to the inhibition of tumor growth by reactivation of antioxidative enzymes. This study advances our understanding of tumor growth inhibition by brewed GT in an animal model by demonstrating tissue localization of GTPs in correlation with inhibition of tumor growth. Our results suggest that the inhibition of tumor growth is due to GTP-mediated inhibition of oxidative stress and angiogenesis in the LAPC4 xenograft prostate tumor in SCID mice.

Abstract
  Clearly, no neoplasm other than prostate cancer has benefited from so many breakthroughs since the beginning of this decade: the past two years can be considered exceptional due to the number of emerging agents against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which have demonstrated positive outcomes in phase III trials. Until 2010, docetaxel (Taxotere) was the only agent capable of improving survival in patients with metastatic CRPC. Since then, positive results from phase III trials have been reported for sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, denosumab, abiraterone, radium-223, and enzalutamide, while other promising agents including notably orteronel, ipilimumab and cabozantinib are currently under study. Taken together, the incorporation of these agents in the routine management of patients with CRPC is likely to expand their median life expectancy, which was only ~1 year until the early 2000, to >30 months in the near future. The availability of these agents will lead to new challenges and questions, such as: Can our societies afford the costs? Should we use these agents sequentially or in combination with an incremental benefit? Can we personalise treatment based on the biology of the individual's disease? How will we develop new active compounds in the context where a half dozen approved agents may confound their potential overall survival effect?
